   Paul Cooijmans &mdash; INTP: "The abstract-minded system architect"
  </h1>

  <h2>
   Dominant function: Introverted Thinking (Ti):
  </h2>
  <p>
   Paul Cooijmans' primary mode of cognition is focused internally, on logical understanding, and he is exceedingly good organizing his understanding of the world at large and different concepts into structured, precise thought. His writings suggest a mind that has spent a great amount of time and effort pondering complex questions and reaching an intricate and exhaustive understanding of whatever topic he brings up.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like most people with an Introverted Thinking dominant function, Paul Cooijmans is drawn to exploring impartial systems and has a tendency to abstract himself from the "human dimension". He also typically views interpersonal exchanges and relationships through a thick lens of logic and reason.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a strong introvert, Paul Cooijmans places little value in external metrics or standards, or even the objects themselves, instead displaying a preference to abstract away from the object and discover what part it has in a system. He had admittedly not much faith in hierarchal power structures or traditional forms of authority, much preferring to work alone or alongside others as equals and without competition.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Auxiliary function: Extraverted Intuition (Ne):
  </h2>
  <p>
   Constantly curious and eager to learn more, Paul Cooijmans easily generates ideas of his own and spots potential in other people's ideas. He has deeply original and ingenious thought patterns that allow him to analyze common problems from unique perspectives and argue multiple sides of a debate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul Cooijmans does not hesitate to mentally explore and theorize in areas that humanity on a whole has very little knowledge of, such as the existence of extraterrestrial life and the future evolvement of humanity as a species. Being a dominant thinking type, Paul Cooijmans uses Ne mainly in service of Ti, with focus on hatching new ideas for careful categorization, systemization, and analysis.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Tertiary function: Introverted Sensing (Si):
  </h2>
  <p>
   Paul Cooijmans leads a highly structured and regimented lifestyle by his own choice. He is highly receptive to the internal impressions which personal experiences &mdash; particularly negative ones in his childhood and adolescence &mdash; have left upon his psyche.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has a visible need to present himself as competent in dealing with his surroundings and his health, which include precise management of diet, training and exercise. Paul Cooijmans has a very good memory and finds it easy to memorize and retain facts, both independently and as components of a system.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Inferior function: Extraverted Feeling (Fe):
  </h2>
  <p>
   This is Paul Cooijmans' weakest function and appears as considerably repressed in his cognition. He takes a very Ti-centric approach to both interpersonal dynamics and morality at the cost of empathy and fellow-feeling, and he has little understanding for people who do not operate within the rational boundaries of morality.
