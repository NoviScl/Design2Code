        <h2>What's It All About</h2>
        <p>In early June national parties began running the first of the so-called "issue ads." Contentwise, there is little to distinguish these ads from ads put out by the presidential campaigns themselves other than the fact that the disclaimer says "Democratic National Committee" or "Republican National Committee" rather than "Gore 2000, Inc." or "Bush for President, Inc." The presidential candidates and their proposals feature prominently. However, because issue ads ostensibly serve a party-building purpose, the parties can fund this type of ad with soft money, like that raised in their record-breaking $20 million-plus fundraisers.</p>
        <p>Issue ads fill a gap in the period between the end of the primaries and the national conventions when the campaigns are not on the air. The precedent for pre-convention issue ad activity was set in the 1996 campaign. Despite the hue and cry raised about abuses in that campaign, the rules governing this area have not been changed.</p>
        <p>The net effect of issue ads is to render spending limits meaningless. As a condition for receiving federal matching funds in the primaries, the Gore campaign was subject to a spending cap (the Bush campaign did not have such restrictions). In the general election, the campaigns may not spend more than the $67.5 million grant. In addition, the parties can spend $13.68 million in coordinated expenditures on behalf of their nominees. When the parties can spend tens of millions more on candidate ads masquerading as issue ads, such limits have no meaning.</p>
