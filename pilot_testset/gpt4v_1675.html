    In October, the 35th Georgia was ordered to Evansport, Virginia, where it was placed under the command of Major General Theophilus Hunderburk Holmes. Along with the 2nd North Carolina, 2nd Tennessee, 47th Virginia, Fredericksburg Artillery, Maryland Artillery, Caroline Light Dragoons and Stafford Rangers, these units made up Brigadier General Samuel Gibbs French's brigade.

    The winter of 61-62 was deadly for the Confederate forces in northern Virginia, but not because of battle casualties. Measles especially struck the newly formed Army and spread quickly, leaving many dead in its wake. Soldiers, having grown up on isolated farms all their lives, with a lower immune system to many of society's germs, were especially susceptible to this, and other diseases. In January of 1862, Secretary of War J. P. Benjamin wrote to Brig Gen Holmes advising he could not afford to withdraw the 35th, "but humanity requires that I should try some way to prevent suffering and mortality among those troops just called from a southern clime and weakened by disease." He requested Holmes to lighten the 35th's duty as much as possible to give them a chance to recover.

    In March of 62, the entire brigade presented itself in parade to General Joseph Eggleston Johnston, the commander of the Confederate Army in the East. Impressed, Johnston awarded the 35th Georgia new uniform's as the best drilled regiment on general review.

  <h2>Joseph E Johnston and George B McClellan</h2>

    The war had been fairly quiet in the East during the prior month. After being embarrassed at Bull Run (Manassas) in July of 1861, Lincoln had replaced Gen Irwin McDowell with General George Brinton McClellan, who was now in command the Union Army of the Potomac.

  <p class="text-section">
    Landing his forces at Newport, Virginia, his army quickly moved up the peninsula. The 35th was put in a new brigade under the command of newly appointed Brig general James Johnston Pettigrew.
  </p>
  <p class="text-section">
    Falling back, General Johnston massed his troops east of Richmond, placing his army between Richmond and McClellan's Army. Within two months of landing on Virginia soil, McClellan's forces looked down on the heights upon the capital of the Confederacy.
