            <p>Hi,</p>
            <p><strong>Hi Eran,</strong></p>
            <p>Happy to see that we are not the only place where we find open to be a problem. I took a look at your module and while the approach is sound, I decided the complexity doesn't seem to be worth it.<br>
            - Ka-Hing</p>
            <p>I don't have numbers that show the improvement we got from moving open to a thread pool, but what I can say is that on our environment, open can sometimes take an unreasonable time to complete - several seconds.</p>
            <p>I noticed it several years ago, after I added a feature of 'performance counters' to my module (posted it here - <a href="https://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,255847,258854#msg-258854">https://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,255847,258854#msg-258854</a>).</p>
            <p>This is the reason I decided to implement the async open - in order to avoid having all worker active requests hang for so long. In my case, I was already using open file cache, and while I got a fairly good hit ratio, these extreme cases of worker hanging for few seconds wasn't something I wanted to accept. Also, in my setup, I'm not using proxy_cache - my servers serve as origin servers behind a CDN, so a solution that is limited to file cache is not something I could use.</p>
