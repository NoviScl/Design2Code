    Free Standards Group Announces General Availability Of Linux Standard Base 2.0 : I believe that one of the true keys of Linux success is standardization between distributions. There was an attempt some time ago with United Linux to create a standard file system, but Red Hat never signed on so it didn’t get far. <br><br>
    Today, however, we have the Free Standards Group, of which Red Hat is a member. <br><br>
    The Free Standards Group also announced today that the standard has earned support from the majority of Linux distribution vendors throughout the world, marking a significant stage in the deployment of a true global standard for Linux. <br><br>
    As for United Linux, it’s still around with Suse as its only remaining major player. (But Caldera – now SCO – is in there, so how can you lose...)

    After using Linux for 4 years now, I am buying a Mac because of incompatibility of Linux. Linux users do buy commercial software if there are any good titles.
