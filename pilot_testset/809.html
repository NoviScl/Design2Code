     Don't start with anything.?
     <br>
     <br>
     Even then still don't buy anything until you are actually ready to build then build in phases. It's good idea to get all the mechanical parts before starting on the frame so can offer them up and see any potential hidden problems you missed in the CAD design stage.
     <br>
     <br>
     Electrics are one of the last things you'll need so don't buy those until mechanical is nearly finished. While it's tempting and exciting when it's first machine to buy motors etc and have spinning on bench it's also numb thing to do because your wasting warranty.
     <br>
     <br>
     Don't rush and have clear plan and design in mind.
     <br>
     <br>
     Good luck.

     Whilst I agree with you Jazz,
     <br>
     <br>
     I have bought most of the build kit, with only a roughed out design.
     <br>
     <br>
     At least now it won't be new carpets, furniture, decoration, etc instead. I have enough in the garage to start a construction and except for a pulley or belt or something, probably finish it too.

     Can you give us some idea what you want to cut ? It makes an awful lot of difference if we know whether you just want to gently slice spongecake or hew titanium at warp speed.

     <br>
     daveoHave you done any research on the forum and looked at some of the very capable machines if you are not careful you will waste a lot of money.
     <br>
     <br>
     It shows you have not done much as you are looking at 25mm ball screws with linear supported rails.
     <br>
     for a decent machine for the size you are looking at you will need 1610 on X and Y and 1605 on Z also the square rails have come down a lot in price are are far better.
     <br>
     <br>
     First start a build log with a new post to keep all the questions in one place and then design something in cad there is no problem copying other people designs and then you will have a much better idea.
     <br>
     The golden rule is don't buy anything until you have a design sorted then the wise ones on here will put you right.
     <br>
     Good luck with the build .

     yes you are correct, still trying to find out what i want, i have looked but cant find any builds like i want and was hoping for a few suggestion and then start reading
     <br>
     so the 25mm ball screws i was looking at are to big?

     Believe it or not (and you probably won't until you do the sums) an oversized ballscrew will be a bigger limitation on performance than, say, the weight of the gantry. Especially a 5mm pitch as it has to spin faster than, say, a 10mm pitch,  for a given speed.

     ball screw 1610 on X  and Y 10mm pitch and 1605 on Z 10mm pitch ( whats the best motors for theses)

     Dave whilst we'll all gladly point you in right direction with what's required for componets etc you are still the one who's got to build this machine so if don't do the research and come up with design and fully understand it then 90% chance your going to fail or at very least waste lot of money.
     <br>
     <br>
     For instance You say 1400mm but haven't got clue what's required to have machine that length and not run into problems which can and would come with it if not done correctly.
     <br>
     There is no short cut to doing this correctly so if you Fail to prepare by doing the research then prepare to Fail.
     <br>
     <br>
     Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to put you off, far from it.
     <br>
     <br>
     Strongly urge you to do the research and learn what's required and involved in building machine the size your asking. When you have done this it will become clear why the questions you are asking now are premature and potentialy dangerous to your wallet.
     <br>
     <br>
     Do what Clive says start build thread and ask questions about anything you don't understand.  By this I don't mean ask about suppliers this comes later and by which time you'll know exactly what you need.
     <br>
     First You need to know how to make the machine tick and why what you choose makes it ticks this way.!
     <br>
     <br>
     Do this and I'll gladly part with my knowledge but won't help anyone waste money( It would Kill yorkshire Man to see wasted cash.!!)

     Hi Daveo
     <br>
     Just adding my words to what Jazz and Clive S have advised PLEASE take their advice.
     <br>
     <br>
     My router has a 1100mm, 700mm and 300mm ballscrews and may well be suitable for the types of projects you are suggesting.
     <br>
     <br>
     Anyway good luck with your design and build
     <br>
     <br>
     Regards
     <br>
