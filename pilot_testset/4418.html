   By delivering Our Lady of Kazan the Blue Army Betrays the Fatima Message Fatima
  </title>
  <meta content="Tradition In Action presents the debate between Fr. Ladis J. Cizik, director of the Blue Army and editor of Soul magazine and Dr. Marian Horvat. Horvat says that handing over the symbolic icon of Our Lady of Kazan is a  betrayal of the mission of the Blue Army. Horvat also shows that Russia is not really converted, and that the message of Fatima about the conversion of Russia has not been fulfilled." name="description">

               There was a time when the Blue Army was representative of the message of Fatima in all its integrity, that is to say, a message about the future of the world, the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant.
               <br>
               <br>
               As part of the message, Sister Lucia gave us to understand a special mission for Portugal, which would maintain the Faith.
               <br>
               <br>
               The Fatima message had a clearly militant character because it implied the victory of good over evil, not only a transformation of evil personal lives and customs, but also the fall of an evil social and economic regime, Communism. An important part of this message was that Russia &ldquo;would be converted.&rdquo; Therefore, the message in its full integrity also signifies a censure of the Greek Orthodox Church, which, as Catholic Church teaching clearly states, is a schismatic Church because, as Spirago&rsquo;s
               <i>
                Catechism
               </i>
               explains, &ldquo;it will not acknowledge the supremacy of the Holy See.
               <b>
                while we call them the Schismatic Greeks.
               </b>
               &rdquo; (1) This expression used by Our Lady, conversion, means that the Russian Schismatic Church was &ndash; and is &ndash; on the wrong pathway.
               <br>
               <br>
               <font color="#800080" size="4">
                <b>
                 The new &ldquo;message&rdquo; of Vatican Cardinals is clearly incomplete
                </b>
               </font>
               <br>
               <br>
               Now, these were presuppositions of the message of Fatima for most faithful Catholics.
               <br>
               <br>
               What is certain is that the Prelates&rsquo; interpretations of this released text are misleading and contradictory.
               <br>
               <br>
               What would this imply?
               <br>
               <br>
               It would imply that there is no more crisis in the Church, even though many Fatima experts like Fr.
               <br>
               <br>
               It would imply that there is no more need for the conversion of Russia.
               <br>
               <br>
               And the time of peace that would be granted to the world after Russia&rsquo;s conversion?
               <br>
               <br>
               Finally, it would imply that there is no more need for Russia&rsquo;s conversion from the heresies of the Schismatic Church, even though the doctrine and the facts say the opposite.
               <i>
                Duma
               </i>
               amended a law on religious freedom to forbid any proselytism that attempts to attract believers away from the Schismatic Church.

               <br>
               <br>
               Why are Vatican organs trying to change the reality and drain all the seriousness from the message of the Mother of God?
               <br>
               <br>
               The ecumenical initiatives of John Paul II provide at least one answer.
               <br>
               <br>
               This action would be &ldquo;a prophetic sign that can be interpreted in the light of the message of Fatima,&rdquo; the lead article by Marguerite Peeters in the December issue of
               <i>
                Inside the Vatican
               </i>
               glibly explains.
               <br>
               <br>
               Accepting this same erroneous presupposition,
               <i>
                Inside the Vatican
               </i>
               editor Robert Moynihan stresses the urgency of delivering the statue &ldquo;so that Russia can return to the faith&rdquo; &ndash; not to the Catholic Faith, mind you, but to the heretical creed of the Schismatic Church.
               <br>
               <br>
               The icon of Our Lady of Kazan, one of Russia&rsquo;s most venerated icons, had been carried by generals into battles since the 13
               <sup>
                th
               </sup>
               century and is the symbol of Russian victory and liberty.
               <b>
               </b>
               took over Russia in 1917, they turned this great Cathedral into a museum of atheism.
               <br>
               <br>
               Around 1950, the icon re-emerged in England.
               <br>
               <br>
               Then, more recently, someone had the very unfortunate idea to give the symbolic and miraculous icon to John Paul II so that he could bring it back to Russia, based on the false notion that the conversion was done, the promises fulfilled.
               <br>
               <br>
               If the first idea of purchasing the icon was genial, this second one was extremely lamentable, to say the least. The initiative would be the coronation of these erroneous interpretations &ndash; the death of Communism and the conversion of Russia &ndash; as well as an indirect assertion that the Russian Schismatic Church is not in error.
               <br>
               <br>
               What was the glory of the Blue Army has become its shame.
               <br>
               <br>
               What more can be said about this sad drama that is unfolding in our days?
               <br>
               <br>
               The Blue Army has reneged on its mission, rolled up its banners, claimed that the fight is over and the battle is won. But in reality, by this action, the Blue Army is confirming the message that it is trying to deny.
