         When you're ready to build a circuit using SMT parts, there
         are 4 different ways (that I'm aware of) to get your surface
         mount components actually soldered to a
         <a target="_blank">
          PCB
         </a>
         .
         Mind you, I haven't done this (yet) myself, so here I'm just
         passing along information from folks who actually have done
         this.
         <p>
         </p>
         <ol>
          <li>
           <b>
            Discrete pin soldering by hand
           </b>
           <br>
           You'll need a needle tip on your soldering iron, SMT
            solder (low melting point solder in a very fine
            diameter), a water-soluble solder flux pen, a steady
            hand, and some sort of magnifier (to see what you're
            doing on such small things).
           <br>
           <br>
           Start by laying down a thin layer of solder flux on the
            pads. Place the chip on the pads (watch the alignment!)
            and gently press it in place. The flux should have just
            enough "stick" to it to hold the chip. Carefully solder
            one pin on one corner, then verify the chip's alignment.
            Now solder one pin on the opposite corner, then verify
            alignment again.
           <br>
           <br>
           If all is well, carefully solder each pin in order,
            working your way around the device. Use the iron to heat
            the pad, then flow the barest amount of solder from the
            pad under the pin. Watch for solder bridges; if you get
            any, use a very fine solder wick to remove the
            bridge.
           <br>
           <br>
           One version of this is as follows: lay a piece of solder
            across the ends of the pins (so it touches both the pins
            and the pads) along one side of the chip. Touch the
            solder with a hot iron at the end of the solder. It will
            melt onto the pad and pin. Without moving the solder, do
            the next pin, and the next, till the side is done. Each
            time you touch your iron down, the end of the solder will
            be perfectly placed for the next joint.
           <br>
           <br>
          </li>
          <li>
           <b>
            "Painting" pins
           </b>
           <br>
           Use a large tip (1/8th inch wide or more) soldering iron.
            Stick the chip onto the layout using the flux technique
            given above. Tack one lead in place at each of two
            opposite corners, to hold the chip in position. Coat a
            fair amount of solder onto the iron's tip then, in one
            smooth stroke, paint all the leads on one edge by wiping
            the iron's tip down the length of the chip. Repeat for
            all edges.

            Hot air stream -- reflow "pen"
           </b>
           <br>
           Here, you'll need water-based solder paste, an iron or
            hot-plate and frying pan, and some sort of gizmo that can
            produce a thin stream of very hot air (you can spend
            about $700 US on a commercial one, or see
           <a target="_blank">
            here
           </a>
           for a way to build one for about $20). For
           <b>
            SO
           </b>
           components, put a dab of solder paste on each pad. For
           <b>
            TSSOP
           </b>
           components, put a thin line of solder paste
            across each row of pads. Put the chip on the pads and
            push it down. Preheat the board with components on an
            inverted (flat side up) clothes iron, or an old frying
            pan on a hot-plate. Carefully "spray" the pads with the
            hot air to melt the solder.

            Toaster oven
            <br>
           </b>
           Here, you need water-based solder paste and a toaster
            oven. Note that the oven needs to be "dedicated" to this
            use; small bits of lead will (at least potentially) move
            around while you're heating boards, so you won't want to
            use this oven with food after using it for circuit
            boards. For
           <b>
            SO
           </b>
           components, put a dab of solder
            paste on each pad. For
           <b>
            TSSOP
           </b>
           components, put a
            thin line of solder paste across each row of pads. Put
            the chip on the pads and push it down gently. Put your
            board into the oven, heat it up to melt the solder, then
            turn off the oven and open the door. Wait for the solder
            to cool and solidify before you take the board out of the
            oven.

           This is essentially an at-home version of commercial
            "reflow" soldering. The Seattle Robotics Society has
            details on this method (oven temperature profile,
            pictures, etc.)
