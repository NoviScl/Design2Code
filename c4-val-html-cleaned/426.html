  <pre>Dear all,

I would like to draw your attention to a stochastic parameterization session being held at the forthcoming AGU Fall 
Meeting in San Francisco.  The abstract submission web site is now open, with a deadline of 6th August, and we would 
welcome your contributions.

NG020 - Stochastic Parameterizations in Numerical Weather and Climate Models

Description:

The representation of subgrid scales by stochastic processes in state-of-the-art General Circulation Models (GCMs) has 
reached such a level of maturity that stochastic parameterizations are now found in operational NWP models and GCMs. 
Among candidates for stochastic representation are backscatter of vorticity from unresolved to resolved dynamical 
scales, subgrid-scale convection, subgrid-scale gravity waves in the ocean and/or atmosphere, and boundary-layer mixing. 
We invite members of the numerical modeling community who are investigating the implementation of these and other 
stochastic parameterizations in both global and regional models to share their experiences and results in this session.

Conveners:

Paul Williams, University of Reading.
C&eacute;cile Penland, NOAA.
Adam Monahan, University of Victoria,

Kind regards,
Paul.
