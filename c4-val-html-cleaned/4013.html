    <h2>ST AUGUSTINE &amp; ST THOMAS ON CREATION</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><em>God created  all things, including time, together at the beginning of time… Yet, as regards  their substance, he created them in some measure formless.</em>        St  Thomas Aquinas </p>

    <p>There is a dilemma in the first chapter of the Book of <em>Genesis</em>.&nbsp; Verse 1 says: ”In the  beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”&nbsp; Then, in verses 2 to 31 of the same chapter,  creation is revealed as taking place over six days with different elements on  each day.&nbsp; In confirmation of what verse  1 has to say, we read in <em>Sirach</em> (Ecclesiasticus) 18: 1—“He that lives  forever created all things at once.”</p>
    <p>The Church, the one interpreter of sacred scripture,  ruled on the revelation contained in these and other passages of scripture in  1215 in the definition <em>Firmiter</em> of the Fourth Lateran Council: “Firmly we  believe and simply we confess that the one true God… by His own almighty power  at once (simul) from the beginning of time made each creature from nothing, the  spiritual and the corporeal, namely, the angelic and the earthly, and then man”.  (DS 800) &nbsp;But if creation  occurred <em>at once</em> (instantaneously),  how can it be said to have occurred over six days?</p>
    <p>There  is a further dilemma between revelation and the results of rigorous scientific  investigation.&nbsp; Whether creation occurred  instantaneously, or over six days, as <em>Genesis</em> chapter 1 says, modern science seems to show that it occurred in a certain  sequence which, while roughly in accordance with the sequence revealed in  verses 2 to 31, is punctuated, not by days, but by immense periods of time,  millions, if not billions of years.&nbsp;  Which is right—revelation (creation instantaneously or over six days),  or modern science?</p>
    <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *</p>
    <h3><em>St Augustine</em></h3>
    <p>In his  exegesis of <em>Genesis</em> chapter 1, St    Augustine distinguishes creation “in the beginning”  (in verse 1) from what follows in verses 2 to 31, as “creation  in its inchoate state (<em>inchoatae creaturae</em>) called heaven and earth  because of what was to be produced from it” (<em>De Genesi ad litteram</em> 1, 6,  12).&nbsp; “Here”, says St Augustine, “the origin of  created being is indicated still in its imperfect and formless state” (<em>in  informitate imperfectionis</em>) (<em>Ibid</em> 1, 4, 9).&nbsp; He goes on: “[I]t is obvious that everything  subject to change is fashioned out of something formless… It is of this  formless matter that the inspired writer speaks when he says to God: <em>Who  hast made the world out of formless matter…</em> (<em>Wisdom</em> 11: 18).&nbsp; We must conclude then that this same matter  is referred to… in a manner accommodated to unlearned readers or hearers, when  before the enumeration of the days it is stated: <em>In the beginning God  created heaven and earth</em>…” (<em>Ibid</em> 1, 14, 28)&nbsp; “But”, he goes on, “we must not  suppose that unformed matter is prior in time to things that are formed; both  the thing made and the matter from which it was made were created  together.&nbsp; A voice is the matter from  which words are fashioned… [b]ut the speaker does not first utter a formless  sound… and later gather it together and shape it into words.&nbsp; Similarly, God the Creator did not first make  unformed matter and later, as if after further reflection, form it according to  the series of works he produced… [T]he material out of which something is made,  though not prior by time, is in a sense by its origin prior to the object  produced”. (<em>Ibid</em> 1, 15, 29) </p>
    <p>Thus, St Augustine addresses  the dilemma and seeks to resolve it by distinguishing the ontological (the  order of reality) from the chronological (the order of time).&nbsp; Things may happen at the same time (<em>simul</em>),  yet there is an order in which they occur.&nbsp;  Almighty God may have created the sea and the fish in it together, yet  the sea is prior to the fish in the order of reality.&nbsp; He may have created earth and the plants  together, yet the earth is prior to the plants in the order of reality.</p>
    <h3><em>St Thomas </em></h3>
    <p>St    Thomas had the benefit of another and more fundamental  distinction in his treatment of the first chapter of <em>Genesis</em>, one  derived from the <em>Metaphysics</em> of Aristotle.&nbsp; In his <em>Commentary on the Sentences</em> of  Peter the Lombard, St Thomas says this—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      [T]hose things which pertain to faith are distinguished in two  ways.&nbsp; For some are of the substance of  faith per se, as that God is triune and one, and such like; in regard to which  no one may lawfully have an opinion otherwise.&nbsp;  Hence the apostle, in Gal.1, says  that if an angel of God should preach a gospel other than what he was teaching,  let him be anathema.<br>
        But other things [pertain to the substance  of faith] per accidens only, namely, insofar as they are dealt with in  Scripture, which faith takes to be promulgated under the inspiration of the  Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Regarding these things,  such as historical matters, they who are not under any obligation to know the  Scriptures can be ignorant without danger [to their faith].&nbsp; In regard to these things, indeed, the saints  have diverse opinions, expounding the divine Scriptures in diverse ways.<br>
        So, therefore, with regard to the beginning  of the world there is something that pertains to the substance of the faith,  namely, that the world began to be by creation, and all the saints speak with  the one mind in this regard.&nbsp; However, in  what way and according to what order it was made does not pertain to the faith  except per accidens, insofar as this is dealt with in the Scriptures, whose  truth saving by diverse exposition, the saints have handed down in diverse  ways.<br>
        For, according to Augustine, in the  beginning of creation certain things were made in their proper nature through  their distinct species, as the elements, celestial bodies, and the spiritual  substances; but other things in their seminal reasons only, as animals, plants  and men, all of which were produced in their proper natures in that work in  which God elaborated nature previously established in those seven days;  regarding which work it is said in John 5: 17: My Father works, and I work, until now.<br>
        Nor in regard to the distinction of things  ought one to attend to the order of time, but to that of nature and  doctrine.&nbsp; Regarding nature, as the sound  precedes the song, in nature but not in time; and so what are naturally prior,  are first brought to mind, as earth before animals, and water before fishes, as  with others.<a  name="_ftnref1" id="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span> </a>
    </p></blockquote>
    <p>Later, in the <em>Summa  Theologiae</em>, St Thomas  developed his thought.&nbsp; Sacred Scripture  discloses, he says, three works—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      Namely, the work of creation, as given in the words, In the beginning God created heaven and earth; the  work of distinction as given in the words, He  divided the light from the darkness, and the waters that are above the firmament  from the waters that are under the firmament; and the work of adornment,  expressed thus, Let there be lights in  the firmament. (Summa Theologiae I, q.  65).&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the next question he deals with the work of distinction.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      God is an agent absolutely perfect; wherefore it is said of Him (Deut.  xxxii: 4)—The works of God are perfect.&nbsp; Therefore the work of His creation was at no  time formless…&nbsp; Hence we must assert that  prime matter was not created altogether formless, nor under any one common  form, but under distinct forms.&nbsp; And so,  if the formlessness of matter be taken as referring to the condition of prime  matter, which in itself is formless, this formlessness did not precede in time  its formation or distinction, but only in origin and nature, as Augustine says;  in the same way is potency prior to act, and the part to the whole. &nbsp;(Ibid I, q.  66, a. 1).&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He concurs  with the view of Augustine that God created all things, including time,  together at the beginning of time (I, q. 66, a.  4).&nbsp; In question 74 he addresses the seven days of  creation.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      God created all things together so far as regards their substance in  some measure formless.&nbsp; But He did not  create all things together, so far as regards that formation of things which  lies in distinction and adornment.&nbsp; (I,  q. 74, a. 2, ad 2).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In his answer  to the previous objection in the same article, he explains what he means by  this—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      On the day God created heaven and earth, he created also every plant of  the field, not indeed in act, but before  it sprung up in the earth, that is, in potency (I, q. 74, a. 2, ad 1).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And in answer  to the fourth objection in the same article he says—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      All things were not distinguished and adorned together, not from a want  of power on God’s part, as requiring time in which to work, but that due order  might be observed in the instituting of the world.&nbsp; Hence it was fitting that different days  should be assigned to the different states of the world, as each succeeding  work added to the world a fresh state of perfection (I, q. 74, a.2, ad 4). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em>A note of  clarification</em>—When  St Thomas speaks of ‘matter’ he is not using that term in the way we commonly  use it.&nbsp; ‘Matter’ is a metaphysical  term.&nbsp; It means that indeterminate thing  which has no characteristic of its own whatsoever save this, that in communion  with substantial form, it results in material substance.&nbsp; When St Thomas speaks of ‘substance’ he is  not using that term in the way we commonly use it, as something material,  considered amorphously, ignoring its make-up.&nbsp;  ‘Substance’ is a metaphysical term.&nbsp;  It means ‘that whereto befits be-in-self, or ‘that which stands up by  itself’.&nbsp; A tree is a substance; a bird  is a substance; a man is a substance; an angel is a substance—each of these  things is an instance of ‘be-in-self’.&nbsp;  In contrast to substance is ‘accident’, which is not, as in common  parlance an unfortunate happening, but a metaphysical reality.&nbsp; Accident is defined as ‘that whereto befits  be-in-other’.&nbsp; Colour, for example, is an  accident.&nbsp; Green cannot exist by itself,  but it can exist in a tree; blue cannot exist by itself, but it can exist in  the sea.&nbsp; It cannot exist by itself, but  only in something else, only in some substance.&nbsp;  Accordingly, for metaphysicians ‘matter’ and ‘substance’ are not  identical but opposed.</p>
    <p>When St Thomas speaks of <em>the  condition of prime matter, which in itself is formless</em>he is simply insisting that from its  nature matter is utterly indeterminate.&nbsp;  When, later, he says that God <em>created all things together so far as  regards their substance in some measure formless</em> he is speaking  of the essential constitutive of each of God’s creatures that makes it be what  it is but, not yet in act, only in potency.</p>
    <p>Almighty God  created all things together at the beginning of time <em>in potency</em>.&nbsp; That due order might be observed, that each  succeeding work should add to the world a fresh state of perfection, He then  brought that potency to act in the sequential order indicated in verses 2 to  31.&nbsp; Thus, though God created all things  together so far as regards their substance, St Thomas says, <em>he did not create all things together so far as regards that formation  of things which lies in distinction and adornment.</em></p>
    <p>A more  detailed explanation of the doctrine of potency and act, and of what is meant  by prime matter, is set forth as an appendix to this paper.</p>
    <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *</p>
    <p>In her wisdom  Holy Mother Church has ruled on the meaning of the word <em>yom</em>, ‘day’, where it appears in verses 2 to 31 of chapter 1 of <em>Genesis</em>,  in the following question and answer—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      Q.&nbsp; Whether in that designation and distinction of  six days, in the first chapter of Genesis, the word Yom (day) can be taken either in its  proper sense as a natural day, or in the improper sense of a certain space of  time; and whether among exegetes it is permitted to discuss this question  freely?<br>
        A.&nbsp; Affirmative. &nbsp;(DS 3519)<a  name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span> </a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In addressing  the second dilemma, it is open to exegetes to interpret ‘day’ as a certain  space of time rather than a natural 24-hour day.&nbsp; The extent of the ‘certain space of time’ is  not specified and so, is not limited.&nbsp;  Exegetes are entitled, then, to accept an interpretation of <em>Genesis</em> chapter 1 which accords with the  chronological unfolding of the elements of creation while accommodating these  immense periods of time.&nbsp; As to any  discrepancy in detail between the two, they may rely on the words of Pius XII  in the encyclical <em>Humani Generis</em> (12.8.1950) that—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      the first  eleven chapters of Genesis… in simple and figurative language adapted to the  mentality of a people of little culture both state the principal truths upon  which the attainment of our eternal salvation depends and also give a popular  description of the origin of the human race and the chosen people.&nbsp; (DS 3898)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yet a problem  remains.&nbsp; For St Thomas goes on, in the extract from his <em>Commentary  on the Sentences</em> quoted above, to agree with St Augustine’s view about the chronological  ordering in verses 2 to 31.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      Moses, instructing a primitive people about the creation of the world,  divided into parts what was made at the same time.&nbsp; Now, Ambrose and other Saints hold that there  was an order of time observed in which things were distinguished; and this  opinion is indeed more common, and seems to accord better with the apparent  literal sense.&nbsp; Still, the previous  opinion [of Augustine] is more reasonable and better protects Holy Scripture  against the derision of unbelievers, which Augustine teaches (De Gen. I, 19)  must be especially heeded: ‘the Scriptures are so to be explained as not to  incur the ridicule of unbelievers’; and this opinion I find more satisfying.<a  name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span> </a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But he  was not compelled to exclude the possibility of a chronological sequence.&nbsp; After all, he had said that any reference to  God requiring time in which to work did not imply a want of power on God’s part <em>but that due order might be observed in the instituting of the world,</em> and that it was fitting <em>that different days should be assigned to the  different states of the world as each succeeding work added to the world a  fresh state of perfection.</em> &nbsp;The  metaphysical doctrine does not demand temporal simultaneity between the  creation of a substance in potency and the bringing of that potency to  act.&nbsp; This can be seen, for instance, in  the fertilised ovum and the time that elapses before the potency in that egg  can be brought to act in the fully mature human being.&nbsp; Again it can be seen in desert places where  the seeds of plants can lie dormant for twenty or thirty years to sprout on the  sudden occurrence of rain.</p>
    <p>Anyone  who reads St Thomas’s consideration of the views of the Fathers and Doctors of  the Church on sacred scripture will see that he makes every effort to  accommodate the diversity of their views and does not disagree without  reason—see, for instance, his remark in the <em>Commentary on the Sentences</em> quoted above: <em>In regard to these things, indeed, the saints have diverse  opinions, expounding the divine Scriptures in diverse ways.</em></p>
    <p>St    Thomas, as St    Augustine before him, acknowledged a principle which  justifies reliance on the evidence manifested in advances in natural knowledge  to assist in the interpretation of sacred scripture, namely, that the Christian  is bound by the demands of reality no less than by what God has revealed.<a  name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span> </a>&nbsp; What lies behind this principle has been  mentioned, namely: <em>the Scriptures are so to be explained as not to incur the  ridicule of unbelievers.&nbsp; </em>It would  seem that the concern each expressed in his day over an interpretation of <em>Genesis</em> 1 which required six days for Almighty God to complete the creation of the  world was that it would lead an unbeliever to deride God as incapable of  accomplishing the task instantaneously.</p>
    <p>There was no  evidence at the time St Thomas was writing to show a chronological sequence in  the appearance on earth of plants, of animals and of man, and hence no need for  him to adopt a view different to that enunciated by Augustine on this  issue.&nbsp; But the evidence is otherwise  today! &nbsp;For the findings of rigorous scientific  observation disclose great passages of time between the first appearances on  earth of the various elements of God’s creation.&nbsp; To avoid the ridicule of unbelievers in the  21st century, then, it is incumbent upon exegetes to look for an  explanation which does no violence to Sacred Scripture yet satisfies the  reasonable expectations of one who, as St Augustine says, <em>derives his  knowledge from most certain reasoning or observation.</em><a  name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span> </a></p>
    <p>St  Thomas’s use of the doctrine of potency and act to solve the first dilemma  permits of passages of time between creation at once (simul) in the beginning  when all things were created <em>so far as regards their substance in  some measure formless and the work of distinction and adornment when different  days [were] assigned to the different states of the world, as each succeeding  work added to the world a fresh state of perfection.</em>&nbsp; St    Thomas’s teaching, taken together with the rulings of  the Church, provides the solution to the second.&nbsp; Moreover, though one can only conjecture at  the mechanism whereby Almighty God brought the potency of his creation to act  in the chronological sequence indicated, it would seem that the two dilemmas  are solved without the need to have recourse to any doctrine of ‘theological  evolution’.</p>
    <p>This being  said, it cannot be denied that difficulties remain in reconciling science with  revelation: for example, with the passages where Almighty God brings all the  animals and birds to Adam to see what he will call them; with the passages  relating to the Fall and its effects in mankind and in the natural world; with  the passages relating to the Flood and its extent, and those dealing with  Noah’s preservation in the Ark of male and female of ‘every living creature of  all flesh’ (ex cunctis animantibus universae  carnis).</p>
    <p>Yet none of  these difficulties can justify recourse to a simplistic literal interpretation  of the early chapters of <em>Genesis</em> which flies in the face of reason and  of rigorous scientific investigation—and liable, therefore, to incur the  ridicule of unbelievers—and which, more importantly, contradicts the Church’s  clear directions on their interpretation.</p>

    <p><strong>Potency  and Act</strong><br>
      [In what  follows language is used in a somewhat unusual way.&nbsp; The reason for this is simple.&nbsp; Every discipline has its own terminology and method  of using language.&nbsp; So does metaphysics.]</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A being (which would be better called a  ‘be-<em>er</em>’) is something which exercises  the act of ‘be’, just as a walker is something which exercises the act of  ‘walk’; and a thinker something, ie, someone (since only a person can think),  who exercises the act of ‘think’.&nbsp; Each  of these categories, ‘walk’ and ‘think’ describes a certain perfection (ie,  fullness of being under some respect) which is found in some things, and not in  others—a tree cannot walk; a dog cannot think.&nbsp;  That fulness of perfection in each category is called ‘act’ from the  Latin <em>actus</em>, literally, ‘does (be) ness’.&nbsp; In his infancy, however, the walker did not  yet walk, nor did the thinker think.&nbsp; Yet  each was possessed of a character which would enable him eventually to exercise  those perfections.&nbsp; That character is  called ‘potency’ from the Latin <em>potentia</em>,  literally, ‘can-be-ness’.&nbsp; This character  is something real, not imaginary.&nbsp; It,  too, is part of being.&nbsp; This division of  being into act and potency is illustrated by the following analysis of the  arguments of three Greek philosophers.</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greek Philosophers</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Parmenides  (c.515-440 BC) argued as follows—<br>
        That  which is, does not become (because it already is!)<br>
        But  being is.<br>
        Therefore,  being does not become; ie, there is no change, no movement; all these are but  illusions of the senses.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Heraclitus  (c.545-480 BC) argued to the contrary, as follows—<br>
        That  which becomes, is not (because what is has no need of ‘become’).<br>
        But  everything becomes (changes).<br>
        Therefore  nothing is; i.e., nothing does be; reality is pure become, pure change or flux,  and there are no stable natures, or things.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Aristotle  (384-322 BC) solved the dilemma as follows—<br>
        Being  embraces not only what is (what does be) ie, act, but also what can be, i.e.,  potency.&nbsp; Against Parmenides, then, it  must be argued:<br>
        <em>That  which is (does be) actually, does not become</em>—conceded.<br>
        <em>That  which is (does be) potentially, does not become</em>—denied.<br>
        This  premise failing, his conclusion fails.</p>
      <p>Against  Heraclitus, too, it must be argued:<br>
        <em>That which becomes, is not (does not be)</em>—denied,  since being embraces not only that which does be, but also that which can be.<br>
        This premise failing, his conclusion also fails.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These issues can be more easily understood by the following illustration  using the science of astronomy.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Newton does not  become an astronomer—for he is (does be) an astronomer.<br>
        Young Jack (a boy) becomes an astronomer, for  though he does not be, yet he can be, an astronomer.<br>
        A tree does not become an astronomer, for it  cannot be an astronomer.<br>
        Therefore, there is something real in Young Jack  which is not in the tree.&nbsp; This is not  the does-be-ness (act) of astronomy; it is the can-be-ness (potency) of  astronomy.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>From this it  will be seen that potency is not privation—a mere lack of something—but  something positive, <em>real capacity for act</em>.&nbsp; St    Thomas, following Aristotle, says that being is <em>res  quae habet esse</em>, ‘thing which has be’<a  name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span> </a>; or, <em>res  cui competit huiusmodi esse</em>, ‘thing whereto befits such be’<a  name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[7]</span> </a>.&nbsp; Being embraces whatever does be or can  be.&nbsp; This is why St Thomas says in the <em>Summa Theologiae</em>,  as quoted above—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      God created all things, including time, together at the beginning of  time.&nbsp; Yet, as regards their substance,  he created them in some measure formless.&nbsp;  Thus, on the day God created heaven and earth, he created also every  plant of the field, not indeed in act, but before  it sprung up in the earth, that is, in potency.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now of all the perfections that a thing  can enjoy, the most fundamental is that which is expressed in Latin as <em>esse</em>,  ‘be’, which in English we translate poorly as ‘existence’.&nbsp; For every other perfection, every other act  (e.g., walk, talk, live, think, laugh, converse, love) is only such in virtue  of the fact that it first exercises the act of ‘be’, i.e., it exists.&nbsp; Be (<em>esse</em>) is, then, rightly called  ‘the act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections’.</p>
    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      Act  is <em>intrinsic principle of perfection</em>.<br>
        Potency  is <em>intrinsic principle of perfectibility</em>.<br>

    <p><strong>Matter and Form</strong></p>
    <p>Everything dependent in regard to its be (i.e., everything not God) is  composed of potency and act, i.e., essence (or nature) and be (existence).&nbsp; In material things, essence is itself  composed of potency and act, called matter and form, or, more precisely, prime  matter and substantial form.</p>
    <p>Substantial  form is that which makes the material thing be what it is, whether rock, or  tree, fish or fowl or animal, or man.&nbsp; It  is that which determines its nature.&nbsp;  This form is immutable and infallible; it does not change or  ‘evolve’.&nbsp; It is the act which, received  in the potency of matter, determines it to be rock, or tree, fish or fowl or  animal, or man.</p>
    <p>Prime matter  is that which is determined by substantial form to produce the material  substance.&nbsp; It is pure potency, pure  can-be-ness; of itself utterly indeterminate.&nbsp;  Without the limitation and specification of substantial form, it is  formless.&nbsp; Yet it cannot exist as such  but only as determined by some form; hence St Thomas’s teaching quoted above—<em>The work  of God’s creation was at no time formless—in the sense that prime matter was  first created undetermined by any form</em>.<a  name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[8]</span> </a></p>
