     Prayer to St. Gerard for the parents of a sick child, and the
child:
    </h3>
    <p>
     O St. Gerard, who, like our Savior, loved children so tenderly and
by thy prayers freed many from disease and even from death; graciously
look down upon the distressed parents who plead with thee for their
child's  health if such be the Will of God. Present their promise to
God to bring up the child a good Catholic and to guard it by word and
example against the fatal leprosy of sin.

     A prayer to our Lord for intercession of Our Lady of Perpetual
Succour:
    </h3>
    <p>
     O Lord, grant unto us Thy grace, we beseech Thee, so as to realize
Thine almighty power wrought by the intercession of Our Lady of
Perpetual Succour. Thy Spirit surrounds us, Thine all-seeing eyes fix
upon us, and Thy Divinely Sacred Heart yearns for us, that we may
cease to tremble at the smites of the Godless, and no longer shrink
from the ridicule of those who serve the Prince of this world.

     The Traditional prayer to Saint Michael, the Archangel:
    </h3>
    <p>
     O Glorious Archangel St. Michael, Prince of the heavenly host, be
our defense in the terrible warfare which we carry on against
principalities and powers, against the rulers of this world of
darkness, spirits of  evil.  Come to the aid of man, whom God created
immortal, made in His own image and likeness, and redeemed at a great
price from the tyranny of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fight this day the battle of the Lord, together with the holy
angels, as already thou hast fought the leader of the proud angels,
Lucifer, and his apostate host, who were powerless to resist thee, nor
was there place for them any longer in Heaven.  That cruel, that
ancient serpent, who is called the devil or Satan, who seduces the
whole world, was cast into the abyss with his angels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Behold, this primeval enemy and slayer of men has taken courage. Transformed into an angel of light, he wanders about with all the
multitude of wicked spirits, invading the earth in order to blot out
the name of God and of His Christ, to seize upon, slay and cast into
eternal perdition souls destined for the crown of eternal glory.
    </p>
    <p>
     These most crafty enemies have filled and inebriated with gall and
bitterness the Church, the spouse of the Immaculate Lamb, and have
laid impious hands on her most sacred possessions.  In the Holy Place
itself,  where has been set up the See of the most holy Peter and the
Chair of Truth for the light of the world, they have raised the throne
of their abominable impiety, with the iniquitous design that when the
Pastor has been struck, the sheep may be scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arise then, O invincible Prince, bring help against the attacks of
the lost  spirits to the people of God, and give them the victory. They venerate  thee as their protector and patron; in thee Holy Church
glories as her defense against the malicious power of hell; to thee
has God entrusted the souls of men to be established in heavenly
beatitude.

    <h4>
     Prayer of St. Ambrose (Before Mass)
    </h4>
    <p>
     Lord Jesus Christ,I approach Thy banquet table in fear and
trembling, for I am a sinner, and dare not rely on my own worth, but
only on Thy goodness and mercy. I am defiled by many sins in body and
soul, and by my unguarded thoughts and words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord Jesus Christ, eternal king, God and man, crucified for
mankind, look upon me with mercy and hear my prayer, for I trust in
Thee. Have mercy on me, full of sorrow and sin, for the depth of your
compassion never ends.
    </p>
    <p>
     Praise to Thee, saving sacrifice, offered on the wood of the cross
for me and for all mankind. Praise to the noble and precious blood,
flowing from the wounds of the my crucified Lord Jesus Christ and
washing away the sins of the whole world.
