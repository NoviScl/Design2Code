   <strong>
    At last some contrary evidence:
   </strong>
   <br>
   It is possible to maintain a  conviction so intense that one rejects conflicting evidence.&nbsp; One of the most blood curdling examples is a  book called
   <em>
    The Witches&rsquo; Hammer
   </em>
   by a  couple of inquisitors Sprenger and Kramer.&nbsp;  The book was immediately rejected by the Catholic Church, but since  there were a lot of witch trials and no other book to tell you how to do it,  the wretched thing survived.&nbsp; They say  that the judge at the Salem witch trials had a copy on his desk.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   What Sprenger and Kramer did  when faced with what they thought was contrary evidence was to explain it away  as a devilish plot to discredit them. There is no arguing against something like that.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   Over the years I have found a  lot of supporting evidence. I do not  deliberately suppress what seems to be in conflict with me, but I find so  little of it that I rarely am put to the test.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   In order for me to have a  problem with that, I must satirize my own position that marriages between unrelated  people produce fewer children and that this accumulates over generations. Let me phrase it, &ldquo;Outbreeding is the root of  all evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not what I think, but  it&rsquo;s close enough for present purposes.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   Marriages are in decline. Right.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   The divorce rate is high and  rising. Right.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   There aren&rsquo;t enough babies  for us to survive. Right.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   But look a little closer and  a crack appears. As it turns out,  divorce and out of wedlock children happen more among the poor than among the  rich.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   Oops.
  </p>
  <p class="style1">
   It might be possible to do some  hand waving and reconcile the facts. But  without some hard data, such hand waving would remain unconvincing.

   Well I sort of can get to  some statistics again. Godaddy says  there have been 310 &ldquo;hosts served&rdquo; since January 10, 2013.
