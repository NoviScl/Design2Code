<p class="style1"><strong>At last some contrary evidence:</strong><br>
  It is possible to maintain a  conviction so intense that one rejects conflicting evidence.&nbsp; One of the most blood curdling examples is a  book called <em>The Witches’ Hammer</em> by a  couple of inquisitors Sprenger and Kramer.&nbsp;  The book was immediately rejected by the Catholic Church, but since  there were a lot of witch trials and no other book to tell you how to do it,  the wretched thing survived.&nbsp; They say  that the judge at the Salem witch trials had a copy on his desk.</p>
<p class="style1">What Sprenger and Kramer did  when faced with what they thought was contrary evidence was to explain it away  as a devilish plot to discredit them.&nbsp;  There is no arguing against something like that.&nbsp; Once one is sensitive to the process one  tends to see it a lot, and of course it is always important to test ones own  ideas for such a failure.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">Over the years I have found a  lot of supporting evidence.&nbsp; I do not  deliberately suppress what seems to be in conflict with me, but I find so  little of it that I rarely am put to the test.&nbsp;  That has now happened.&nbsp; (The  Fraying Knot ECONOMIST vol. 406 no. 8818 January 12, 2013 page 27)&nbsp;  Marriage is in decline in the United States.&nbsp; It has not  dropped so far as in some places in Europe, but fewer  people marry and fewer children live with both biological parents than in times  past.&nbsp; I suppose there is universal  agreement that children do better growing up with both biological parents.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">In order for me to have a  problem with that, I must satirize my own position that marriages between unrelated  people produce fewer children and that this accumulates over generations.&nbsp; Let me phrase it, “Outbreeding is the root of  all evil.”&nbsp; That’s not what I think, but  it’s close enough for present purposes.&nbsp;  Let’s try it out.</p>
<p class="style1">Marriages are in decline.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp;  Marriage is expected to involve love.&nbsp;  Nature has mandated that all animals that are going to mate are  attracted one way or another to appropriate mates, meaning among other things  mates that are reasonably consanguineous.&nbsp;  We don’t court cousins any longer, so we don’t fall in love.&nbsp; No problem.</p>
<p class="style1">The divorce rate is high and  rising.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; That comes of marrying the wrong person.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">There aren’t enough babies  for us to survive.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; That comes of marrying the wrong person.&nbsp; No problem.</p>
<p class="style1">But look a little closer and  a crack appears.&nbsp; As it turns out,  divorce and out of wedlock children happen more among the poor than among the  rich.&nbsp; But babies are fewer among the  rich than among the poor.</p>
<p class="style1">Oops. </p>
<p class="style1">It might be possible to do some  hand waving and reconcile the facts.&nbsp; But  without some hard data, such hand waving would remain unconvincing.&nbsp; The fact is that there is a conflict here.&nbsp; I am overlooking an issue.&nbsp; I wish I knew what it was.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1"><a >Home page</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">Well I sort of can get to  some statistics again.&nbsp; Godaddy says  there have been 310 “hosts served” since January 10, 2013.&nbsp; I suspect  that this means what I used to call “visitors,” but technical support had no  idea what “hosts served” might mean.&nbsp; And  there have been 801 successful requests for pages, which I suspect means  articles called up.&nbsp; Again Godaddy was no  help in explaining what they were talking about.&nbsp; So I expect to go on saying how many “visitors”  have accumulated starting this year.&nbsp; </p>
