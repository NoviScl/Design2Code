    A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,
        I was shopping for shoes at a department store in a mall. I
        didn't find any shoes, but I noticed the background music was
        "Fly Me to the Moon." I think it was Tony Bennett. They had the
        sound turned down so you couldn't quite hear the lyrics, and I
        got to wondering, "Is it 'Let me play among the stars' or 'Let
        me wish upon a star'?" I made a mental note to find out.

   <font face="Verdana">
    That weekend I was at my girlfriend's house,
        coming down with a cold. She didn't want to kiss me - I didn't
        blame her - but she also didn't want to do anything else,
        either, as if I could infect her simply by... oh, never mind. We
        turned in early - well, midnight is pretty early for me - so I
        could get plenty of rest against my illness, and I and my little
        viruses quickly fell asleep.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font face="Verdana">
    I awoke around 3:30 a.m. The back of my
        throat was draining, and all the swallowing made it hard for me
        to get back to sleep. Because I normally sign off quite late, my
        early retirement this night acted like a nap, and I was now wide
        awake. Meanwhile, the guy upstairs was talking in a drone. I
        threw a pillow over my head.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font face="Verdana">
    At 5:40 I noticed I was sweating under the
        pillow and tossed it aside. I also had acquired a sinus
        headache. The guy upstairs was still yammering away, the low
        tones of his voice rumbling relentlessly into the room, and I
        realized there were people who not only went to bed later than
        I, they talked all the way down. I reasoned that if I aimed
        carefully I could use the sound of his voice, shoot through the
        ceiling, and hit him. But I didn't have a gun.
   </font>
  </p>

    At this point the cat sat down on the floor
        next to the bed and began laboriously and noisily licking its
        rear end. I wondered for a moment whether I could strangle him
        and make it look like he'd finally died of old age. Moments
        later a car alarm went off outside. Simultaneously it began to
        rain, and I thought of my car - parked on the street - and its
        leaky window that would shortly give entry to a stream of
        rainwater into the trunk.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font face="Verdana">
    I crouched on my knees on the mattress, the
        top of my head buried in a pillow. My girlfriend stirred. "You
        okay?" she murmured.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font face="Verdana">
    I said, "Well, since you ask... My throat
        hurts, I have a headache, the guy upstairs is
    <i>
     still
    </i>
    talking, a car alarm just went off, it's raining and my car is
        filling up, and your cat is making disgusting self-cleaning
        sounds."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font face="Verdana">
    She suppressed a laugh.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font face="Verdana">
    I went on, "But you know what the worst of
        it is? I can't get '
    <i>
     Fly Me to the Moon
    </i>
    ' out of my head!"
