    Alex and I met in 1999 at Philmont.  I had heard quite a bit
about him from Garrett who was on Rayado with Alex in '96.  I had probably bumped into both 
of them because I was also at Philmont that year.  Anyway, Alex and I were both Mountain 
Trek Rangers and hit it off pretty quick.  Towards the end of the summer, we got two 
breaks from camp and headed up to Colorado.  The first trip we knocked off Humboldt Peak in 
the dark.  We spent the next day lounging at camp and playing with the marmots because of 
uncertain weather.  On the second trip we topped Crestone Needle on the first day and Kit 
Carson Peak and Peak 13,799 the next.  A mountain goat adopted us and hung around our 
camp for a couple days.
