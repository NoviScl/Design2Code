<a >Marek Futrega</a> has a copy
of his Digger Java applet on his site and it's better than the one here because
it saves the high score table.<p>

http://www.imitationpickles.org/rustic/rustic.shtml The
<a >Rustic Classics
</a> version of Digger is a very amusing Digger clone not based on the original
Digger source. The guy who wrote it, Philip Hassey, doesn't want any money for
it, just marbles (I guess he's lost his...)</p><p>

<a >SteppenWolf</a>
has written another Windows/DirectX version of Digger. It looks good but isn't
nearly as fun to play as the original. It's also a 6Mb download.</p><p>

<a >Andy Skyman</a>
created this shrine to Digger. There are some bits of information and programs
about getting the original Digger to run on modern machines as well, if you're
interested.</p><p>

<a >Chris's
Digger page</a> was somewhat out of date last time I looked at it.</p><p>

<a >This site</a> is a blatant
rip-off of www.digger.org but I'm not bitter. I just wish I had his email
address so that I could tell him to put a link back to here so that visitors to
his site knew where to go for the latest versions.</p><p>

<a >Reinder Kraaij</a> of Holland
started a rewrite of Digger in Java before being beaten to it by Marek Futrega.
</p><p>

I barely understand <a >this site</a> at all,
but it's obvious what it's about!</p><p>

<a >Mikel Lavrentyev</a> of Russia has written
a "patcher" for the original Digger which fixes most of the problems. The
loader also has a level editor and many sample levels. This package is highly
recommended, although the patcher does have some unwanted side effects -
neither the speed nor the background music is quite right. The levels from
Digger's Loader are available for use with this version: see
<a >Extra levels</a>.</p><p>

<a >Constantine Klyatskin</a> of Russia has
created a version of Digger for the Palmpilot. It is shareware and costs US$12.
</p><p>

Check out the <a >
Digger category</a> in the Netscape Open Directory.</p><p>

Digger written for a Turkish computer magazine.</a></p><p><a >

</a><a >Doka</a> are soon going to release (commercially)
a game called Digger 2000. I'll let you know more details when I have them. For
now, though, there are some nice screenshots at that site.</p><p>

<a >The Oldskool PC</a> used to host the Digger
site and is an invaluable reference for anyone interested in old games or demos
and running them on modern PCs.</p><p>

<a >Gangsters</a> is a great place to go if you
want to download a computer games that is too old to be found in the shops.
There are no actual downloads on that site, just links to sites that do carry
the games.</p><p>

<a >Mobygames</a> is the ultimate online
encyclopedia of computer games. Go there and vote for your favorite computer
game!</p><p>

<a >Popcorn</a> has everything you ever wanted
to know about the song "Popcorn" and lots more, including lots of versions of
the music in various playable formats.</p><p>
