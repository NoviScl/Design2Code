a quiz or two on topics to be announced.) All activities should be completed
and submitted before or on the due date. Please submit your written work
typed or word processed. Remember to check for spelling and grammar, as
these will effect your grade. See the <a >Grading

progress during the term in our Student-Instructor conferences.

</p><h3>
Group Activities</h3>
Group activities will be assigned and completed in class each week. Participants
will submit individual work based on these assignments. Each group assignment
will be worth 5 points. Grading will be based on participation.
<p><a name="project"></a>
</p><h3>
Technical Project</h3>
The final technical project will include a<b> technical paper</b> (80 pts.)
and a <b>visual presentation</b> (20 pts.) of the project, <b><font color="#FF0000">due
by the beginning of class in Week 11.</font></b> You are encouraged to
choose topics that relate to your professional and personal interests.
Projects that may be used at work are acceptable, although you should check
with your employer regarding copyright and other concerns.
<p>The paper may be in any form of technical communications discussed in
class (e.g., research report, proposal, instructions manual, etc.) . Papers
must be no shorter than 6 pages in length and no longer that 12 pages,
excluding front and back matter.&nbsp; The paper must include significant
research on subjects outside of class. Sources, of course, must be referenced
appropriately.<a name="present"></a>
</p><p>You will also be required to prepare a visual presentation summarizing
your project. This is not a formal presentation, but rather a visual representation
of your work for exhibition. Options include preparing a poster board,
a brochure or manual, or an electronic presentation (e.g., web page) if
equipment is available. The instructor will provide more information and
samples. These presentations will be exhibited for review by the class
in our last meeting.
</p><p><i><b>Important: </b>In order to earn points for your visual presentation,
you must write a critique of at least two presentations (other than your
own).&nbsp; These critiques should be submitted to the instructor during
the last class meeting.&nbsp; Critiques can be short, 2-3 paragraphs, and
should focus on content and execution.&nbsp; Try to comment on what works
and what does not.&nbsp; As these critiques will be shared with the presentations'
authors, please keep your comments polite and constructive.</i>
