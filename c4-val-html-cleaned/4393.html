<p><i>Also by extreme_fj0rd</i></p>
<p>Year_of_the_Fox: And so begins the third stage of our brainwashing program-- 
  I mean Happy Home Hunting Articles! We're here again to show you everything 
  you didn't need to know about places to build a home! </p>
<p>Extreme_fj0rd: Or rather, everything you do need to know. Or don't. Whichever. 
  I'm Fj0rd, this is Fox, and we're on location right now, on a little tiny place 
  we missed before.
</p><p>Fox: Yup. We're here in the land of dice and gambling! Roo Island!... Wee woo... There's 
  not really much here.
</p><p>Fj0rd: There's a Merry-Go-Round! Perfect for young pets or Baby-painted ones. 
  Or even older pets/owners... um... Fox, may I be excused to go ride the Merry-go-round?
</p><p>Fox: Beh. Go ahead. But really. If you wanna bet away all of your money, come 
  here. All the games involve chance and a large chance of it is losing all your 
  neopoints and living in a box begging.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Or getting an awesome avatar. But yeah, there isn't much here on Roo 
  Island. Let's move on... after I'm done riding this Merry-go-round.
</p><p>Fox: ... Just... walk away Fox... Just walk away...  
</p><p>In any case. We'll get right back on course and go south, then east a little 
  ways, then up. To the land in the clouds full of weird creatures with wings 
  and are entirely too optimistic. Faerieland.
</p><p>Fj0rd: "Entirely too optimistic"? You haven't ever met _Yrael, have you... 
  by the way, I'm back from the Merry-go-round.
</p><p>Fox: Ehem... Yeah. Anyways. Faerieland. You start on this. Optimists first.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Ah, very well. Faerieland is an awesome place, full of poofy clouds 
  that are beautiful to look at or just to sit on. Also, since it hovers several 
  hundred feet above the ocean, there's a wonderful view of the sunrise and sunset 
  every day. And who wouldn't want to live somewhere where they could walk down 
  to the store and be in line with a Fire Faerie, an Air Faerie, and an Earth 
  Faerie all at the same time? You'd also be very close to the Hidden Tower, which 
  would be really groovy.
</p><p>Fox: If you can even find the Hidden Tower. Though I guess if you run right 
  into it you've found it. If you have flying pets that's a problem. And if you 
  have little baby pets I say AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. Because you can fall 
  off the edge very easily. And... if you have a Grarrl or a Skeith stay away too... they 
  might... you know... fall though the clouds.
</p><p>Fj0rd: True, the.. sturdier pets might have a bit of a problem, but where better 
  to put your baby pets than in a playpen made of clouds? You wouldn't have to 
  go so far to give quest items to the Uber-Faeries, either.
</p><p>Fox: Don't come if you're afraid of heights either. I mean... whoa... Fj0rd... 
  Can we go now?
</p><p>Fj0rd: You concede that Faerieland is a good place to live, then?
</p><p>Fox: Nooooo... I'm afraid of heights... and I looked down... 
</p><p>Fj0rd: Aww, little Fox can't handle the heights. Oh, okay, we can move along.
</p><p>Fox: Y-yeah. Anyways going down south and west again. We reach the badly named 
  Lost Desert. 'Cause... It isn't lost anymore. It's been found. And I don't get 
  why it was lost in the first place. It's rather big... 
</p><p>Fj0rd: Yes, well, I guess everyone was too scared to go past the Haunted Woods. 
  (Which we just missed, by the way.) Anyway, the Lost Desert is great for you 
  beach Cybunnies. Sand and sun all year around! There are some pretty nifty games 
  here, too, like Pyramids and Sakhmet Solitaire. Also, there's currently a plot 
  going on, adding an edge of excitement.
</p><p>Fox: Fj0rd. Hate to dampen your parade... but if this isn't a good place for 
  beach Cybunnies.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Ha-HA! There isn't any rain in the Lost Desert for you to dampen my 
  parade with! Triumph! Triumph!
</p><p>Fox: ... Fj0rd. There isn't water. Period. Meaning this isn't a place for beach 
  Cybunnies. Anyways. If you want to live here, bring sunscreen, and lots of it. 
  Also any time you go out bring rope, in case you get swallowed in the sand. 
  Oh. And bring a canteen of water. And a map. And a compass. Because out there 
  there is a whole lot of nothing! And if you get lost... too bad. You're dead.
</p><p>Fj0rd: There is so water! There's an inlet!
</p><p>Fox: AN inlet. AN. Meaning ONE. Meaning YOU'LL DIE if you can't get your water 
  rations. So be fast and get there early.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Well...  Terror Mountain doesn't have any inlets at all! So ha! Erm, 
  shall we move on?
</p><p>Fox: Fj0rd. Terror Mountain has SNOW which is frozen water. But next we have 
  the possibly worst place to live. Haunted Woods. OoooooOooo Scary. It's a sign. 
  I know it.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Sure it's scary, but have you ever actually known anyone who disappeared 
  there? No, it's always a friend of a friend of a friend. The Scary Woods are 
  just...  scary. Yeah.
</p><p>Fox: Fj0rd... What are you talking about? There have been tons of neopets who 
  disappeared! THEY WERE EATEN! By the Jelly Chia. I mean. The Haunted Woods is 
  the H.Q. for the villains of Neopia. It's like... BAD. And it's dark. Really 
  dark. No gardening there. Nope. And you become really pale and then you get 
  lost in the woods and then you DIE.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Yes, that's what people say, but have you ever actually known someone 
  who disappeared? It's what's called an "urban legend", Fox. Except in this it's 
  more...  a rural legend.
</p><p>Fox: But still. This is not safe. Not at all. Bad bad bad. Don't move here! 
  Unless you have a death wish.
</p><p>Fj0rd: Well... erm...  there have been plenty of people who've survived living 
  in the Haunted Woods! Right! Erm...  I'd ask that we move on, except that this 
  is the end... 
</p><p>Fox: Oh... You're right. We've been everywhere. Well then. I think we've successfully 
  procured a large army of mindless drones-- I mean given people a good idea of 
  where to build their neohomes!
</p><p>Fj0rd: Exactly! Now, drones, follow me--er, you can stop reading now. Now. 
  Er...  now. Now!
</p><p>Fox: Are you still reading? Go and follow Fj0rd!... I mean... Go out and have 
  fun Home Hunting!... Fox; out.
