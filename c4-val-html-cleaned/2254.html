     <img alt="Standard Poodle therapy dog sits for her photo." class="imageleft" height="300" hspace="8" src="rick.jpg" width="160">
     My Chloe is a timid, young Standard Poodle. She has a very sweet disposition
        and loves children almost as much as she loves dogs! I teach clay classes
        in elementary schools and Chloe began joining me when she was only a few
        months old. Soon she and I began doing more general pet therapy in classrooms,
        including a whole year in one second grade class (chronicled in the children's
        book series, Chloe is in Second Grade). Recently we began visits to special
        education classes called Life Skills classes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Chloe dearly loves children, her innate timidity requires that
        the children be gentle and quiet around her. Initially this seemed as
        though it might be a drawback and reduce her therapeutic efficacy, but
        as it turns out it is a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="Brushing the therapy dog in the special education classroom." class="imageright" height="250" hspace="8" src="rick.jpg" width="310">
     Our
        visits to the Life Skills classes involved mostly one-on-one visits between
        Chloe and the students. These visits usually start with the child petting
        her or brushing her with a soft brush. When the children are more familiar
        around her, we go on walks together, using two leashes and going first
        in the classroom, and later in the hallways. The students feel very important
        and special when they have this job. They decide where they want to go
        and they know that they must take care of Chloe. For some, this is one
        of the few times they feel that they are helping rather than needing help
        and self-esteem grows. We greet people along the way, and when we get
        back to the classroom, we report to the teacher what we have seen, so
        we are practicing a number of skills, especially communication. There
        is quite a variety in their reactions to Chloe's visits. Most of the children
        want to spend time with her, but not all.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="Communication and the special education class therapy dog visit." class="imageleft" height="296" hspace="8" src="rick.jpg" width="310">
     One
        boy named Sebastian was not at all eager to visit Chloe when we came to
        his class. I would always ask him if he wanted to visit with Chloe.. just
        to give him the chance to choose.. and he always said, "NO, no, no!"
        as he made himself very small in his chair. One day when I came in with
        Chloe, Sebastian immediately made eye contact with me, so I knew something
        was up. When I asked my usual question, "Who wants to visit with
        Chloe?" his hand shot up and he said, "I do, I do!" This
        was quite a surprise to all of us, and, of course, we rewarded him with
        an immediate visit. He still did not want to touch Chloe, but he threw
        treats to her as she sat close to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     On our next visit, Sebastian took Chloe for a walk in the hallways. He
        wanted to go to the gym, and I soon found out way.
    </p>

     <img alt="Therapy dog book - there's Chloe!" class="imageright" height="207" src="rick.jpg" width="310">
     When
        the special education teacher read the children a story about Chloe, they
        were very excited to see 'their' dog in a real book. One boy kept asking
        how we got "those" pictures in that book. I can imagine making
        a simple book for them about their classroom showing them interacting
        with Chloe and plan to do so this fall. I know it would be popular and
        some of the students would be able to read it. Seeing themselves and their
        friend, Chloe, in a book would also stimulate many of them to take an
        interest in books, even if they are unable to read.
    </p>

     Finding
        ways to make books enjoyable for children is a challenge at times but
        when I made a similar book for an Autistic preschool I discovered that
        being involved in the process and the subject matter went a long way toward
        doing just that. It's quite simple and requires nothing more than a camera,
        a word processing program, and a local office supply store to put it in
        a spiral binding. If you don't know how to 'embed' the digital photos
        into the actual document , just print them and glue them into place and
        you have enough of a 'real book' for the children to enjoy. In addition,
        all involved tend to get feelings of accomplishment and pride too often
        lacking in such students.
    </p>
    <p>
     A boy named Jack had a good visit with Chloe. His face lit up when he
        saw her and his big smiles got even bigger when he walked with her.
    </p>

     <img alt="Therapy dog brings out the love, in the special education classroom." class="imageright" height="290" src="rick.jpg" width="279">
     More
        self-esteem and eagerness to communicate are sure to accompany Chloe on
        future visits with Jack, Sebastian, and other children with special needs
        who are lucky enough to share time with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Success in learning really comes down to wanting to learn because we
        are happy and motivated. If school wasn't fun, what young student would
        choose to be there?

     Donna Vaquer is the co-author of
     <a>
      The Rainbow Series: Dogs Who Help
     </a>
     . The publisher explains, "This
        is an ongoing series of nonfiction children's books, some sprinkled with
        a bit of fantasy here and there, about real dogs who help others in various
        ways. These books appeal to children from pre-school through fifth grade.
        Because they are nonfiction and illustrated with color photographs of
        the actual dogs in action, they educate as well as entertain. They encourage
        children to learn to read and love it, and all have at least one important
        life 'lesson' about diversity, acceptance, love and animal stewardship.
