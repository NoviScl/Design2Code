<a name="des">Description of the flag</a></h2>

<p>Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta (population: 14,685). A major petrochemical industry in the
area is represented by the gear wheel.<br>
<i>Darrell Neuman,</i> 4 May 2006</p>
<p>I would hazard to guess the hexagon
represents the petrochemical industry (a benzene ring) while the
Mountie represents the historical fort.<br>
<i>Rob Raeside,</i> 4 May 2006</p>

<p>The small flag held by the Mountie is the traditional RCMP lance pennon
which is a feature of the RCMP Musical Ride, as noted at the
<a >RCMP site</a>.

</p><blockquote>

<p>One of the most recognizable Musical Ride formations is
the "Dome," once featured on the back of the Canadian fifty-dollar
bill. The highlight of the Musical Ride is, without a doubt, the
CHARGE when lances, with their red and white pennons, are lowered
and the riders and their mounts launch into the gallop.

</p></blockquote>

<p>Fort Saskatchewan is still listed as an RCMP detachment.  But it is
far smaller than the original detachment which established the fort
(and later moved to Edmonton as "K" Division).

</p><p>The triangular pennon of the North West Mounted Police (i.e. RCMP)
was red and white.  It appears to have originated in the March West
during 1874.  The <a >Q&amp;A page on the Musical Ride</a> notes:

</p><blockquote>

<p>on November 21st 1921, with the approval of King George V, a
Canadian proclamation assigned red and white as the official colours
of Canada. Consequently, on ceremonial occasions, we could hold no
more appropriate colours aloft on our lances.

</p></blockquote>

<p>The flag represents the Dow Centennial Centre, a recreation and cultural 
facility located in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.<br><em>Darrell Neuman</em>, 4 
July 2013</p>

<p>Darrell tells me that he doesn't have different images at his disposal, but 
that the logo appears on all their stationary. Implied seems to be that on the 
flag of the Dow Centennial Centre Flag is indeed the logo of the DCC. It would 
appear that the same logo can be found at
<a >http://www.fortsask.ca/dowcentre</a>.
