I am not sure how to say this any other way, its been said many times 
over and over again : we dont use any super magic juice anywhere, its 
mostly just mock in a for loop. Lets assume that there still exists some 
fear and doubt somewhere about the process in exact terms.

then lets take up the conversation on list where I said that once 6 is 
our of the door, I'll document what and how things worked for the build 
process ( including the pause's and why they took place. Would that 
remove some of this FUD layers ?

I dont agree, if you said 'C' in CentOS is mispelled 'Slower than 
ideal', I'd agree :)

&gt;<i> That said, if CentOS wants it this way they sure have every right to do it

Propose a wording snippet ?
