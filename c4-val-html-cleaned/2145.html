  <h1>        Hilarious! Euro-Poodles Were Not Told of Trump's Syria Withdrawal in Advance, Learned of It From the Media  </h1>

          <p>UK and France have troops of their own illegally in Syria alongside the US. UK has a platoon of SAS commandos or so in Syria's south at Al-Tanf, and France has a few hundred of soldiers in the east with the Kurds.</p>

<p>Despite that Trump did not tell Macron, May and their defense officials, who earlier this year also helped him cruise-missile Syria, that he's withdrawing in advance. They had to learn about it from the media like the rest of us:<br>

<div class="media_embed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>French diplomatic source: France was not consulted with, or warned about the US decision to withdraw troops from Syria.<br>
[France has troops in Syria, and is a partner in the anti-ISIS coalition]</p>

<blockquote><p>European officials, who have troops serving as part of the US-led anti-IS coalition in Syria, suggested they were blindsided by the abrupt decision, even if notified.&nbsp;“No, do you? Does anyone?” one European official, speaking with evident frustration, responded when asked if he had any guidance to offer on the US decision.</p>

<p>It couldn't have happened to a better bunch! He sure showed them their place. Since they don't have a backbone they shouldn't be treated like they do.</p>

<p>Since then France has said that they're leaving too.</p>
