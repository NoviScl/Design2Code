     <p>
      So this was the second part of the dragon adventure series I wrote for my boyfriend. Part one was written for his 19th birthday, and part two was written for his 20th.
     </p>
     <h2 id="part-two">
      PART TWO
     </h2>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Stop fidgeting,&rdquo; I laughed as the not-so-small dragon squirmed under my oily hands. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I loved living on the very top of a mountain where no bad guys or gods could find us, but the constant dry wind did horrendous things to a young dragon&rsquo;s skin and, as the so called Dragon Lord, it fell to me to keep her well oiled, twice daily.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Pff, baby my&hellip;oof,&rdquo; I grunted as Kaida broke free with a &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; nudge of her head and took off towards the mountains edge. Her skeletal wings flapped madly as she attempted to do the seemingly impossible, lift a few dozen tonnes into the air.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Watch! Watch!
      </em>
      Kaida&rsquo;s voice squealed in my head as she panted and puffed. I was used to hearing voices in my head and Kaida&rsquo;s was usually a chaotic rush of words, images and smells, but right now her focus was absolute.
     </p>
     <p>
      She reached the edge and, for a brief instant, her scales glinted an oily pale gold in the setting sun before she vanished from sight. My heart leapt to my throat despite knowing that the young dragon was safe.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You okay, Kaida?&rdquo; I called out to her anyway, strolling to the edge to peer down at the disgruntled dragon caught in a giant spider web of my own creation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Almost! Did you see?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Gently, the web retracted and deposited Kaida beside me where I immediately grabbed the squirming dragon by her neck frill before she could escape again.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Every day you get closer, my dearest, but right now,&rdquo; I ignored the pleading blue eyes, &ldquo;I have to finish rubbing in this gunk before you begin to flake and then flying will be completely out of the question.&rdquo; I tried to sound authoritative, but couldn&rsquo;t quite pull it off. Unlike Faith.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What are you calling gunk?&rdquo; The young goddess frowned as she emerged from the little stone cottage, drying her hands on a cloth. The smell of dinner wafted tantalizing from the open windows and my stomach growled.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       The stuff Ben rubs into my scales. You know?
      </em>
      Images of pale lavender and freshly churned butter assaulted my senses as Kaida gave up on words. Faith must&rsquo;ve received the assault as well because she sneezed twice and broke into a smile.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Well if you don&rsquo;t like the lavender fragrance I can change it,&rdquo; she suggested before Kaida shook her big head ferociously.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       It&rsquo;s good good good good.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done anyway,&rdquo; I said to Faith and then turned back to Kaida who was already beginning to wriggle. &ldquo;Lie on your back, I need to do your belly and then we can have supper.&rdquo; Satisfied with the promise of food, she rolled over and bared her soft dusky-pink underbelly, purring happily.
     </p>
     <p>
      As I finished, Faith handed me her towel and gestured for Kaida and me to wash up before eating. Kaida splashed her talons happily in the barrel of water as I scanned the quickly darkening sky.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       No. Not since breakfast.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      The water was cold and I briskly washed up, slightly worried. When Kaida nudged me in concern, I shrugged off the thoughts and proceeded to playfully wrestle the dragon into the kitchen.
     </p>
     <p>
      That night, after Kaida had drifted off to sleep in her nest of wool blankets, Faith and I both stood outside in the dark, heads tilted back to catch any sign of the falcon. In the complete isolation that we lived in, it was easy to forget that a war was coming.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;She should be back by now,&rdquo; I voiced our fears and searched Faith&rsquo;s face. Her amber eyes were dark with a sadness so deep I was suddenly reminded that this was no normal girl, but a god, countless years older than me.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d have more time,&rdquo; Faith whispered. She shut her eyes and sighed heavily, a heaviness settling round her slight shoulders.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What do I have to do?&rdquo; I asked. A shrill shriek answered me, the only warning before a weight of my own descended upon my shoulders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Tell me everything.
      </em>
      Faith murmured in unspoken words and I waited, slightly impatiently, listening to the one sided conversation. Suddenly Faith&rsquo;s unfocused eyes snapped to mine and in a moment my safe world ceased to exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You must leave. Tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      My backpack was packed with lots of magical goodies. A cloth that supplied an indefinite amount of food, a small pouch that was much larger on the inside and filled with Kaida&rsquo;s oil, and the other important bits that one needed on a journey, especially one with an unforeseeable ending.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What did Meena see?&rdquo; I asked quietly, careful not to disturb the others.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Destruction. It&rsquo;s close too.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; I said and then glanced at the peaceful Kaida. &ldquo;Are you sure Kaida is ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no choice. What kind of Dragon Lord are you if you don&rsquo;t have a dragon?&rdquo; Faith smiled weakly but she couldn&rsquo;t disguise her own concerns.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be alright. Together we can do anything,&rdquo; I murmured into her ear before pulling back.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       It&rsquo;s dark. Nighttime is for sleeping.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Yes my dearest.&rdquo; Faith kissed the sleepy dragon on the head and slipped a dazzling gold chain embedded with blue sapphires around her neck. It was a comment on Kaida&rsquo;s drowsiness, as she didn&rsquo;t notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Stay safe
      </em>
      . Faith thought and disappeared inside. With resolution I stood straight, Meena chirping her displeasure in being wobbled, and we set out into the unknown to create a legend.
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      It was well into the afternoon by the time we reached the plains and Kaida was exhausted. Her bulky size and inability to fly yet made the descent slow and, despite her sharp talons that discovered or created cracks and crevasses to cling to, my heart raced in fear that she might fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       It won&rsquo;t kill you
      </em>
      , Faith said and I breathed a sigh of relief. She&rsquo;d been absent during our long climb down and my concern for her had been hard to conceal from Kaida the ever curious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Where&rsquo;ve you been? I&rsquo;d thought something had happened.
      </em>
      I thought to the goddess, not wanting to interrupt my two companions. From my pack I pulled forth the magic tablecloth and selected a light meal of cheese and hot bread.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I&rsquo;ve been busy elsewhere. I&rsquo;m a goddess, remember, and I&rsquo;ve been neglecting my people of late,
      </em>
      she gently reminded.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Well let me know if you&rsquo;re going to disappear. I&rsquo;ve enough to worry about thank you.
      </em>
      As if to prove my words, Meena let out a shrill warning and I turned in time to see Kaida take off across the fields of grass, hot on the tail of some unknown beast.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kaida!&rdquo; I shouted both out loud and in my mind. She hesitated slightly before her curiosity got the better of her.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       What is it Ben?
      </em>
      Faith cried alarmed.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; I replied and took off after the dragon. &ldquo;Kaida!
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       What is it? It moves!
      </em>
      Kaida said and sent images of a small reddish creature with a long bushy tail and coal black eyes.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kaida! Stop!
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Am I scary? I didn&rsquo;t mean to be!
      </em>
      And Kaida began to keen loudly. It hit me then how young Kaida was. Everyone expected her to be this powerful being. Unstoppable. Dominating. Destructive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       She needs to get use to the idea that she is capable of great force. Talk to her.
      </em>
      Faith murmured, but I needed no prompting. Gathering the young dragon into my arms as best as I could, I soothed her until she was ready to hear the reality that we faced.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Kaida, you&rsquo;re a dragon and no one has seen a dragon for hundreds of years,&rdquo; I began once I knew she was listening. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re must stronger than everyone else and that scares people and animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Even squirrels?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Especially squirrels because they&rsquo;re one of the smallest creatures around. It&rsquo;s your job to look after them.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I can do that. I don&rsquo;t want to scare them.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s protector. We both are, but Kaida,&rdquo; I turned Kaida&rsquo;s head until I was looking directly into her blue eyes, &ldquo;sometimes to save the world we might have to scare it a bit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Sure am! Sure am!
      </em>
      Off she went, all worries forgotten and we continued on our journey. We left the plains two days later, reaching the Forest of Illusion. Kaida had grown another two feet in height.
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       There&rsquo;s somebody watching us.
      </em>
      Kaida said quietly, shrinking into herself and trying in vain to hide her bulk behind Meena and me. Meena perched grumpily on my shoulders as the thickly woven tree canopy made it impossible for her to fly.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, dearest. They&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; I reassured her yet remembered my own trepidation when I&rsquo;d first met the tree dryads.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Back&hellip;dragon lord&hellip;Ben&hellip;saviours&hellip;
      </em>
      Whispers faded into the wind until one wondered whether they&rsquo;d existed at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I feel it too
      </em>
      , Faith whispered quietly.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Hello? Kirra?&rdquo; I called out loud, more to break the suffocating silence then to gain any reply from the elder dryad.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Eep! People!
      </em>
      Kaida cried out in distress and flared her nostrils nervously. The tiny tree dryads had materialised along branches and raised tree roots wielding unstrung bows and glowing bulbs of some sort.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; I repeated mainly to convince myself as the blank unfriendly eyes of the dryads bore down on us.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; one little girl, possibly hundreds of years old, gestured and we fell in to step, surrounded by hundreds of glowing lights.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; I asked quietly to the leader and she sighed sadly, her hazelnut eyes tearful.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kirra will tell you more. We&rsquo;ve waited a long time for your coming and we fear it may be too late.&rdquo; The dryad then turned to Kaida who still hid behind me and bowed to her.
     </p>
     <p>
      Kaida looked at me in confusion, blushing a deep pink and snorted softly. When the dryad looked at me uncertainly I said, &ldquo;Kaida has not met many others before.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      When we reached the very centre of the forest, Faith cried out in alarm. I stopped quickly, Kaida bumping into me.
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      By the light of glow bugs trapped in transparent flower husks, we ate a meat free meal so as not to disturb the dryads. Kaida was happy enough eating berries and tomatoes, her favourite, but Meena grumpily went without.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened Kirra? What went wrong?&rdquo; Carefully, I crouched besides her, taking her tiny hand in my own.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What went wrong was the extinction of the griffons, but that was many years ago. The lack of their guidance and the disappearance of the great dragons have gradually brought the darkness down upon us.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;The god of emptiness,&rdquo; I interrupted, fear finally condensing into a tangible form. I glanced over to the softly snoring dragon and wished&hellip;well it didn&rsquo;t matter anymore.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;As odd as it may seem emptiness filling emptiness, Dresdner has slowly been corrupting those in power, the magistrates, the army leaders and has even reached the king&rsquo;s court though the king himself is greatly devout to the goddess Aurelia,&rdquo; who I knew to be the goddess of life, power and fertility, &ldquo;which has kept him safe from Dresdner&rsquo;s clutches.&rdquo; The poor little dryad paused, her frail chest cracking like ancient wood as she breathed deeply. Light dappled across her face in patches making her look bruised and peering at my own hands I appeared blue and purple.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe we should have a break. Could I get you something?
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Time is what we&rsquo;ve little of.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite her words, her fellow tree dryads hurried forth with a wide flat basin filled with fresh water and placed the queen&rsquo;s bare feet in it. Immediately her parched skin seemed moister.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kirra, what happened to you?&rdquo; I asked once I was certain she was able to answer.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;When you and your companion falcon received aid from us while fleeing the four, the mage struck me down,&rdquo; she said referring to herself and her oak as one.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;But that was over a year ago! The wounds are still fresh and green!
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Dragon Lord, you passed through our forest eight days ago with the dragon egg still safe in your arms,&rdquo; Kirra explained as my mind reeled.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       You have many questions, my dear, and I&rsquo;ll answer them all, but now is not the time. We&rsquo;ve more important things to discuss
      </em>
      , Faith murmured as I convinced myself that Faith had kept this from me for a good reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Kirra. Tell me what I must do,&rdquo; I said finally.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a long way to go yet and little Kaida,&rdquo; little my foot, &ldquo;has a lot to learn. You must teach her, but you&rsquo;ll not be alone.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by beings?&rdquo; I asked, but she ignored my questions.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you twelve of my best warriors to assist you including my own daughter Anais. They&rsquo;ll guide and teach you as much as they can.&rdquo; Kirra withdrew her touch from my pendent and sighed sadly.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kirra, thank you so much&hellip;&rdquo; looking up to find where the queen had lain was a new oak shoot, green and flexible, enthusiastically growing in the place of the now dead oak. More amazing was what lay beneath the leaves, a tiny baby, its skin dusted with pale green.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the dryad who&rsquo;d first led me to Kirra and I left the joyous festivities to rejoin Kaida and Meena.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You know my name, but what&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; I asked as I settled down next to the still sleeping Kaida. Meena opened one eye suspiciously, ever watchful, before closing it again once satisfied it was me.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Anais. I&rsquo;ll be accompanying you on your journey,&rdquo; the graceful dryad said carefully and turned to leave.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! You&rsquo;re Kirra&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo; I stated rather obviously and she smiled in amusement.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;So it would seem.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Not meaning to sound rude or anything, but how&rsquo;s that possible.&rdquo; I blushed, recalling my Master&rsquo;s own attempt to teach me about the birds and the bees, just as embarrassed, if not more so, as me.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain. All dryads are related to one another, yet we each belong to a set family.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Bedtime Ben.
      </em>
      Faith prompted, sounding slightly odd and I nodded.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late Anais and I don&rsquo;t think I could cram any more knowledge into my head tonight. I assume we&rsquo;ll be leaving early tomorrow?&rdquo; She nodded in agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;ll see her again,&rdquo; the dryad softly said and vanished into the trees, leaving me to my thoughts.
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
      </em>
      Kaida grumbled as she trailed behind me, wing tips dragging on the ground. The dryads scouted ahead, invisible in the trees and always ready with their bows and spears.
     </p>
     <p>
      We&rsquo;d reached the outskirts of the Forest of Illusion two days ago and we were still in the so-called outskirts. I was beginning to wonder if the dryads were leading us in circles.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Here Kaida. A present.&rdquo; I tossed the spiky ball made of pinecones and twigs towards the unwary dragon and she shrieked as it bounced off her nose.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       That wasn&rsquo;t very nice,
      </em>
      Faith reprimanded as I doubled over with laughter. The poor dragon&rsquo;s face was a picture of innocent shock before she smirked, an odd look on a dragon indeed, turned and used her tail to bat the ball right at me. With a yelp, I ducked just in time and the toy rushed into the trees&hellip;collecting a dryad on the way.
     </p>
     <p>
      I was horrified. Kaida hadn&rsquo;t even noticed.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard,&rdquo; I said to Faith, supervising the commencing &lsquo;ball game&rsquo; between the dryads and Kaida.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Her problem will be learning that not everybody is good and just,
      </em>
      Faith murmured in the back of my mind.
      <em>
       I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll be hurt.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Hush. People approach,&rdquo; Anais said as she swooped down from a branch, an unspoken command sending the dryads into the trees after gently, but quickly, herding Kaida towards me.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       What is it? A surprise?
      </em>
      The young dragon questioned as I firmly gripped her spiked head and pulled her to the ground. Even laying flat on her belly, her chin on the ground, she was hard to miss despite the dense foliage.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Hush Kaida. We don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re friends
      </em>
      , I whispered in her mind and her blue eyes widened. Somehow she managed to keep still though, to compensate, her mind was wriggling at a formidable pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Will they hurt us? What&rsquo;ll they do?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Kaida, can you smell them?
      </em>
      I asked, trying to focus and calm her mind. A figure moved above our heads and Anais stood posed, every muscle straining as she waited.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Metal. I smell metal and
      </em>
      not able to describe it she sent the image of me running and the smell of my sweat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Sweat, my dearest. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called.
      </em>
      Faith stated, apparently able to receive Kaida&rsquo;s thoughts as well. I glanced up at Anais; she still stood frozen, head slightly cocked as if she could hear something. My leg began to cramp.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I smell hair and dung. They&rsquo;ve an animal with them.
      </em>
      Kaida exclaimed, sensing the men&rsquo;s horses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Ben, there must be a mage with them. A powerful one.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; Anais whispered next to my ear. It took all my control not to yelp with surprise.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Stay hidden in the trees. Be ready.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Okay Kaida, we&rsquo;re going to go meet these people. I don&rsquo;t want to surprise them so go nice and slow and stay with me,&rdquo; I said standing up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Are they friends?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go find out,&rdquo; and we began stomping towards the strangers. Kaida whistled through her teeth and I sang, though horribly, as loud as I could.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve noticed you,&rdquo; Anais called from the trees, her voice disguised by the wind in the trees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       They&rsquo;ve stopped. Are they afraid?
      </em>
      Kaida asked, nervously. The incident with the squirrel was still bothering her.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never met someone like you before. You&rsquo;re one of a kind.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; I called out once we were well within hearing distance. The troop had taken up ranks in a small clearing, lances were lowered and bows raised.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tall dapple-gray stallion stood proudly, his rider encased in dulled steel, well worn and used. They stepped cautiously towards where we&rsquo;d stopped in clear view of all two hundred men.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sir Nicholas Graywolf. Who&rsquo;re you and your companion?&rdquo; bellowed the knight, loud enough for all his men to hear.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Ben and this is Kaida.&rdquo; I felt inclined to bow, but the tension was so thick I feared to move. Kaida though felt no restraints.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Is that a horse?
      </em>
      And before I could stop her, she settled down on all fours and approached Sir Graywolf&rsquo;s horse. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the stallion didn&rsquo;t even blink. In fact, he in turn gave a friendly nudge to the delighted young dragon who squealed in pleasure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sight was so amusing that I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh and Sir Graywolf chuckled quietly. The tension dissipated, hands unclenched swords and I approached the knight.
     </p>
     <p>
      On closer inspection, the knight was quite young, strongly built, and he moved with the grace of his namesake. He rested his gloved hand upon his horse&rsquo;s neck, keeping a wary distance from Kaida, and looked the dragon up and down.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Well isn&rsquo;t this unexpected. Here my men and I are searching the impossible search and the impossible lands right at our feet.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kaida is definitely one of kind,&rdquo; I proudly boasted while firmly taking hold of her neck frills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       But I want to meet Wolf&rsquo;s friends.
      </em>
      She whined, tugging gently towards the other horses that no longer appeared frightened. It should have surprised me that Kaida could talk to animals, but then again, Meena and I communicated. Speaking of Meena. I looked up and sensing my thoughts, Meena&rsquo;s shadow fell across myself, Sir Graywolf and the sulking Kaida, landing delicately on my shoulder.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sir Graywolf startled back, hand reaching for his sword before laughing at his own actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;This is Meena,&rdquo; I said and the falcon pierced the knight with her eyes before turning to preen her feathers.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Anyone else you should introduce me too?&rdquo; Sir Graywolf asked and Anais, perfect timing as always, dropped down beside me, barely reaching the knight&rsquo;s chest.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Anais of the House of Oak. Sir Knight, you&rsquo;re a long way from home,&rdquo; she stated to the pale man.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;My lady. Perhaps we should make camp.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ah, so he hadn&rsquo;t been completely oblivious.
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      After a wonderfully miraculous meal supplied by me to two hundred odd men and their horses, Sir Graywolf, Anais, the rest of the dryads, Kaida, Meena and myself (and let&rsquo;s not forget the ever present, omniscient Faith) retired to Sir Graywolf&rsquo;s tent to discuss important matters. To my pleasant surprise, a magical non-burning fire glowed cheerily in the centre surrounded by rugs and pillows.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;So Sir Graywolf, where should we begin?&rdquo; I asked after we&rsquo;d settled. Kaida grumbled tiredly behind me having had to crawl on her belly to enter the tent.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Please, call me Nick. Let me explain our purpose for being here in the Forest of Illusion,&rdquo; Sir Nick started, back straight as he sat cross-legged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I sure hope I meet their expectations. I&rsquo;m sorta small for a salvation,
      </em>
      Kaida frankly stated, nostrils still flared. I laughed, stroked her affectionately on her snout resting on my lap and glanced up into Sir Nick&rsquo;s startled eyes. I watched him, my grin fading as his eyes darted between Kaida and myself in confusion.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Is there something wrong, Sir Nick?&rdquo; I asked. Anais shrugged slightly from where she sat beside the hulking knight, curious as well to the friendly knight&rsquo;s sudden peculiar behaviour.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me but&hellip;surely you&rsquo;re not the prophesied Dragon Lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      I was gobsmacked, tossing up between whether I should laugh or be terribly insulted. Okay, so I may not look overly warrior-like, remember I was only twenty summers old but I was proud of my muscular though lean frame and my lightness would make it easier for me to fly on Kaida.
     </p>
     <p>
      &rdquo;&lsquo;Fraid so. Not what you&rsquo;re expecting?&rdquo; I said, noticing Kaida had fallen asleep and her soft breathing was sending sparks of magic fire up into the air.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Please forgive me, my lord. Just the stories led me to believe&hellip;well it&rsquo;s of no importance.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Please Sir Nick, call me Ben and I wasn&rsquo;t offended. I can understand your expectations of Kaida and me are high.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;How big&rsquo;s she going to get?&rdquo; he asked.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll ever stop growing,&rdquo; I laughed, clearing the air somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;How far until Kullaberg. I assume that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll go?&rdquo; Anais piped up.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Six weeks at a steady pace,&rdquo; Sir Nick informed us and my heart constricted painfully. Only that long?
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Will that be enough time?
      </em>
      I asked Faith, her comforting presence always in the back of my mind.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       It&rsquo;ll have to be.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Kaida snorted again heavily, one eye slit open to watch me.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I&rsquo;m not at all comfortable,
      </em>
      she informed me.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Yes my dearest,&rdquo; I acknowledge her. &ldquo;Kaida needs some rest.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rest would be excellent,&rdquo; Anais agreed and her fellow dryads followed her out into the night and into the native trees, quite possibly to meet up with relatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Let me guess, we head out first light?&rdquo; I muttered to the remaining knight and he laughed, a deep bellowing bark.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to moving with an army, small though ours is.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      I gently woke Kaida and led her half asleep to a clearing set-aside just for her. Some of the soldiers had made a nest from spare blankets and Kaida happily fell into a deep sleep.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Remind me to thank the soldiers for the blankets,
      </em>
      I asked Faith as I snuggled up beside the snoring dragon. Kaida automatically lifted a wing over me, almost protectively and for the first time I saw that she wasn&rsquo;t a baby anymore.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Sweet sleep my dears.
      </em>
      Faith whispered.
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      The dawn greeted us with rosy fingers and, with a grumble, I arose to the clunking of metal and soft snuffing of horses.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;You arise my Lord!&rdquo; Sir Nick hailed me. There seemed to be no doubt on his face that I was the Dragon Lord and I wondered what had changed his thoughts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       He still doubts you, my dear. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to prove your birthright as Kaida&rsquo;s rider,
      </em>
      Faith commented and I could sense her disapproval. She obviously believed that my mere presence would be enough to believe in.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Kaida&rsquo;s rider? I&rsquo;d never really thought&hellip;well&hellip;she wouldn&rsquo;t be big enough for a while yet!
      </em>
      I glanced at the stirring dragon, one eye the size of an orange slitting open warily.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I&rsquo;m afraid that time will be sooner than you think,
      </em>
      Faith informed me as BAM! Something flew out of nowhere, tackling me to the ground and near squashing me. As I struggled to breathe, Kaida giggled into my head,
      <em>
       you&rsquo;re it!
      </em>
      And took off through the startled knights.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Kaida! You almost broke a rib!
      </em>
      I yelled, but took off after the chortling dragon. Her bulk didn&rsquo;t slow her down and soldiers happily got out of her way as she sprinted out of camp, wings flapping excitedly. Within moments we&rsquo;d left the camp behind.
     </p>
     <p>
      To be honest, I was impressed with my own fitness as I was not only able to keep up with the dragon, but actually gained ground until my outreaching arms grasped her tail.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Look out!
      </em>
      Faith called out. It was too late. It took a moment to realise we&rsquo;d run out of earth and we plummeted fast.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Kaida! Flap!&rdquo; I shouted, watching as the faint silver thread beneath us became increasing wider as we raced towards the river.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then we were flying. Kaida got the rhythm and we were soaring, higher and higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Yeeha!&rdquo; I shouted in delight, my fear instantly replaced by elation as my beautiful Kaida flew up towards the clouds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Look Ben. I&rsquo;m really doing it.
      </em>
      Her thoughts no longer jumbled and overwhelming, Kaida had become a young lady and together we flew. They were my wings that pumped the air, it was her hands that grasped smooth scales, it was our tail that twisted and curved and our eyes that viewed the patchwork landscape beneath us.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       We rock!
      </em>
      I crowed, throwing my arms back in sheer glee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       You need to head back.
      </em>
      Faith finally interjected. She sounded proud of us, yet I sensed that she was slightly disappointed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Yes indeed. Anais and Sir Nick will be concerned,
      </em>
      Kaida agreed and we turned towards the thin trails of smoke that marked our camp.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Are you okay Faith?
      </em>
      I asked quietly to her so Kaida couldn&rsquo;t hear. It seemed the dragon and I was even less separable now, her emotions and some thoughts wafting over my own. In a place reserved for Faith alone, I asked her.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       I wish I were with you,
      </em>
      she whispered, barely a thought. I knew what she meant and I hugged her with my mind.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       We&rsquo;ll be together soon, I promise.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      Our arrival back in camp was impressive. The only thing that could&rsquo;ve made it more so was if Kaida was breathing fire (of which Faith had promised would happen eventually and probably in the worst situation possible).
     </p>
     <p>
      Anais was thrilled that Kaida could fly and her and her sisters raced through the treetops within shouting distance to the dragon. At some moments it seemed that the dryads could fly themselves, using acrobatic leaps and death defying moves to cross the treetops in steadily thinning woodland.
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be reaching the edge of the forest within three days,&rdquo; Sir Nick informed me. He still looked down on me as, despite having borrowed a horse, I was still quite a bit shorter than him.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lunch was no big affair. Food was shared on the run (or actually the horse if you wanted to be literal) with a very short break to water the horses before we continued at our seemingly neck breaking pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Come fly with me
      </em>
      , Kaida cooed and how could I resist? With a well-calculated leap, that surprised even myself, I jumped upon Kaida&rsquo;s back as she flew down low to get me. She impressively bugled her happiness, startling more than a few men and horses and took off into the clouds. Her practice had obviously paid off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       The Forest of Illusion goes on forever!
      </em>
      Kaida said, awed by the blanket of green beneath us, spotted and striped with lakes and rivers. Behind us, the trees were impenetrable, but here we could see the light refracting off armour as Sir Nick&rsquo;s troops road through the trees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       What&rsquo;s that on the horizon?
      </em>
      I asked, confused, a silver shimmer almost blindingly bright.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going. To the land of Whiteness
      </em>
      , Faith informed us both.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Pfft, how inventive
      </em>
      , Kaida said bemused.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Sir Nick is right. We&rsquo;ll get there in three days.
      </em>
      Faith continued thoughtfully.
     </p>
     <p>
      I frowned.
      <em>
       Time for what?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      ***
     </p>
     <p>
      Three days later we left the Forest of Illusion. It simply ended.
