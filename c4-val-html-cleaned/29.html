<h1>Can You Enter Canada with a Marijuana Possession Conviction or Civil Infraction?</h1>
<p>
In some cases, an arrest or conviction related to cannabis can render an American 
criminally inadmissible to Canada.  If an offense is considered an indictable or hybrid 
crime according to the equivalent Canadian statute, the visitor may be 
denied admittance at the border unless they have obtained special permission for entry.
</p>

<p>
In October 2018, Canada legalized recreational marijuana and implemented The Cannabis Act creating a legal framework to control the production, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana in the country.
Consequently, an American with one or more convictions for simple possession of marijuana under 30 grams may be allowed to enter Canada, since the equivalent offense north of the border is no longer a crime in a broad range of circumstances.
This being said, <b>there are still many marijuana offenses that can cause issues at the Canadian border!</b>
</p>

<p>
If a visitor has a conviction that involved 30 grams or more of cannabis, or 7.5 grams or more of concentrates, he or she could still be denied entry by Canadian immigration officials.
If the person has an offense that involved the sale or distribution of the drug, such as possession of marijuana with intent to sell, they could also be considered criminally inadmissible.
Additionally, offenses related to "illicit marijuana" in states that have legalized cannabis can lead to issues when traveling to Canada, even if the black market cannabis was only for personal use.
</p>

<p>
<b>The onus is always on the visitor to prove their admissibility to Canada</b>, so it is advisable to bring police or court documents to the border if you may need to prove to Canadian immigration officials that an offense involved less than 30 grams of pot.
Many US states have marijuana possession laws that include quantities greater than 30 grams. In Texas, for example, getting caught with a small joint can lead to a conviction for two ounces or less which is double the Canadian cutoff.  Without being provided with adequate documentation by a visitor, border agents will not necessarily know if the offense involved
a small amount of pot or 30+ grams which could render the person inadmissible to Canada on the grounds of criminality.
Please note: when visiting Canada, you are never allowed to bring cannabis with you across the border (even if you are traveling from a jurisdiction where it is legal).
</p>

<p>
Police across America make a marijuana-related arrest every 58 seconds. While such arrests are on the decline, they are still extremely common
and millions of US citizens have an arrest record that involves cannabis. Questions about getting into Canada with a criminal history for marijuana? <b>Phone

<h3>Marijuana Manufacturing or Distribution</h3>
<p>
Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute or any charges related to trafficking marijuana (including operating a cannabis dispensary or other marijuana-related business) can render a person inadmissible to Canada. Marijuana production offenses related to the creation or distribution of marijuana edibles, shatter, oils, or extracts can also result in the individual being considered inadmissible to Canada.
Individuals who have been convicted of illegally growing marijuana in USA could also be at risk of a refusal at the Canadian border, especially if they were cultivating more than four pot plants.
Americans who need to travel to Canada but are inadmissible due to criminality can have an <a >immigration attorney</a> prepare a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) or Criminal Rehabilitation application on their behalf.
</p>

<h3>Black Market Cannabis</h3>
<p>
While Bill C-45, also called The Cannabis Act, amended Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) so that possession of cannabis for personal use is no longer a crime that can be proceeded with summarily, it also included a category called "illicit cannabis" which increased the penalties for certain offenses involving illegal cannabis products.
Under s.8 of the Cannabis Act, simple possession of illicit cannabis is a hybrid offense, which means it can be prosecuted by indictment (similar to a felony in the United States). Consequently, according to Canadian immigration law, any offense that would equate to illicit cannabis possession in Canada could render an American criminally inadmissible to Canada.
</p>

<p>
It can be argued that pot possession offenses in US states where recreational marijuana was illegal should not equate to such an offense since legal marijuana was not an option or else the individual would have purchased or consumed the legal version instead. Offenses related to black market cannabis in legal states like Colorado, Washington, and California, however, could now be treated more serious by Canadian immigration officials.
Americans with a single offense related to illicit cannabis may be eligible for automatic Deemed Rehabilitation after ten years.
</p>

<h3>Admissibility Before Legalization</h3>
<p>
Before recreational cannabis was legal in Canada, simple possession of fewer than 30 grams of marijuana was a summary 
offense. This means that even before October 17th, 2018, a single conviction would not necessarily render an American 
inadmissible to Canada.
Two or more minor marijuana possession offenses could cause a person to be considered inadmissible to Canada before legalization, however, even if the violations happened in a state with decriminalized marijuana and only resulted in a civil infraction such as a fine. 
Consequently, before pot was legal in Canada, a person charged with a single Class B misdemeanor for marijuana possession in New York could still be permitted entry to Canada, while a person who had been fined twice for possession or public consumption of marijuana in California (two separate tickets) could be considered inadmissible to the country due to criminality.
Now that simple possession of cannabis for personal use is not illegal in Canada thanks to Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party - both people may be considered admissible to the country and allowed to enter successfully.
</p>

<p>
If you have ever been arrested for possession of marijuana, even if it was an extremely small amount such as a single joint, you should consider obtaining an attorney opinion letter
before attempting to visit Canada. Regardless of whether or not you were criminally convicted of a crime, any violation involving marijuana can potentially lead to
issues at the Canadian border.
Anyone fined or criminally charged for possession of 30+ grams of cannabis, possession with intent, possession of black market cannabis products, or operation of a grow op or other illegal cannabis enterprise, may need to overcome their Canadian criminal inadmissibility with either 
a Canada TRP or Criminal Rehabilitation. Otherwise, <b>they could risk being denied entry when crossing the border.</b>
If you have ever been charged with possession of any other controlled substance or with driving under the influence of marijuana or another drug (DUID or DUI Drugs) you may also be at risk of a border refusal.

<h3>Marijuana Laws in Each State</h3>
<p>
Below we have listed the legality of possession of a small amount of marijuana 
in each US state.  Warning: state cannabis laws are changing extremely fast in 
the United States at the moment, so even though we will do our best to keep 
this page updated it may not be fully accurate at any given time.  This guide 
in no way constitutes legal advice and should never be used as a substitute for
legal counsel; always consult with a lawyer about your specific situation.
</p>

<p>
Most marijuana-related convictions other than simple possession will result in a 
person becoming ineligible to cross the border without a <a >Canada Temporary 
Resident Permit (TRP)</a> or Rehabilitation.  Regardless of local laws, possession of more than 30 
grams of dried marijuana, 7.5 grams of concentrates such as kief, wax, butane hash oil, shatter, or tinctures, or 450 grams of edibles, can result in a person no longer being allowed to enter 
Canada.  Carrying marijuana across state lines, trafficking marijuana, and 
possession with intent to sell can also render an individual criminally 
inadmissible to Canada. Convictions for the possession, production, or distribution of many other types of restricted or controlled substances
can also cause an American to be refused admission at the border. In most cases, convictions for possession of a pipe, bong, or other drug paraphernalia will not cause problems when attempting to enter Canada.
