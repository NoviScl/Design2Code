        The 
        Secret of the Fire lieth hid in the second letter of the Sacred Word. 
        The mystery of life is concealed within the heart. When the lower point 
        vibrates, when the sacred triangle glows, when the point, the middle center, 
        and the apex, connect and circulate the Fire, when the threefold apex 
        likewise burns, then the two triangles &mdash; the greater and the lesser &mdash; merge 
      into one flame, which burneth up the whole.

        within the kingdom of Varuna. They grew and multiplied. In constant flux 
        they swayed. Each ebb of cosmic motion increased the endless flow. The

        built by the watery ones. Matter and water merged produced the third in 
        time. Ascension thus progressed. The builders worked in union. They called

        fire, hid in the Sons of Manas. They called to their Primaries. The lower 
        four, the higher three, and the cosmic fifth met at the great inbreathing. 
        Another sheath was formed.

        The 
        wheels were diverse, and in unification, one. As evolved the great Wheel, 
        the inner fire burst forth. It touched into life wheel the first. It circulated. 
        A million fires rose up. The quality of matter densified, but form was 
        not. The Sons of God arose, scanned the depth of Flame, took from its 
        heart the sacred Stone of Fire, and proceeded to the next.

        and seven times great the heat. More solid grew the formless mass, and 
        deeper sank the Stone. To the heart of inmost fire the sacred Stone went 
        down. This time the work was better done, and the product more perfected. 
        At the seventh revolution, the third wheel rendered back the Stone. Triple 
        the form, rosy the light, and sevenfold the eternal principle.

        the lesser wheel that counted as the fourth. The eternal Lhas looked down, 
        and the Sons of God reached forth. Down to the inmost point of death They 
        flung the sacred Stone. The plaudits of the Chohans rose. The work had 
        turned a point. From the pit of outer darkness, They gathered forth the

        worked thus upon the Stone till all the Sons of God acclaimed, and said:

        The 
        great Triangles in their just arrangement hold hid the secret of the wheel 
        of life. The cosmic fire radiates as directed from the second sphere, 
        controlled by the Ruler of the merging ray. The cohorts of the third encircling 
        sphere in varied ranks mark out the lesser threes.

        The 
        wheel of life still moves within the form. The devas of the fourth connect 
        the thirty-five, and blend them with the central forty-nine. Above they 
        work, seeking to merge the whole. Upward they strive, who in their myriad 
        forms revolve within the wheels of lesser magnitude. The whole is one, 
        yet on the lower spheres only the forms appear. They seem in their divisions 
        more than can be grasped or met.

        The 
        many circulate. The forms are built, become too firm, are broken by the 
        life, and circulate again. The few revolve, holding the many in the heat 
        of motion. The one embraces all, and carries all from great activity into 
        the heart of cosmic peace.
