         I never pay much attention to magazine ads, but the 1995
October issue of Trailer Life Magazine had an ad that caught my eye.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         The ad screamed for my participation in a poetry contest.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         In big, bold type The National Library of Poetry said it
would award $24,000 in prizes.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         My attempts to write prose during the past 10 years has
met with mixed reviews, so why not try poetry?
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I have been told it is better to try and fail than to
never try, so I composed my first ever poem.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I thought my effort resulted in an excellent work of art,
so I submitted a copy to The National Library of Poetry.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Several weeks after I submitted my poem, I received notice
that I was a semi-finalist in the poetry contest. Not bad for a first time
poet!
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         In a personal letter to me, The National Library of Poetry
made this statement, "Fred, you should be genuinely proud of your accomplishment.
We receive thousands of poems each year, and we choose only a very few for
publication."
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         This recognition made me realize that I should have been
composing poems over the past 10 years, rather than wasting my time writing
prose.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         At first, my family gave me accolades for my literary endeavors,
but when I told them that I had to send $49.95 to have it published, they
questioned how good my poem really was.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I explained that if I didn't want it published, I still
qualified for a prize.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         It has been a year since I submitted my poem, and I still
haven't received a prize!
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Oh, by the way, The National Library of Poetry said that
for $38 it would make a plaque with my poem mounted on it.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         They also said that a very few poems are personally selected
to be put on a cassette tape.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         It would only cost me $29.95 plus $4 postage. This sounds
to me like a really good scheme to make a lot of money!
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I was tempted to send $49.95 to have my poem published,
but before I decided to have the poem published, I saw a news item in the
local newspaper about a local woman who was "honored as a distinguished
member of the International Society of Poets and had the privilege of having
her poem published by The National Library of Poetry."
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Is it possible that two outstanding poets would come from
one small town?
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         What really clinched my suspicions was talking to a student
at the local high school who had submitted a poem to this organization and
had received word that she was a semi-finalist.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         She had sent $49.95 to have her poem published.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Can you believe that three semi-finalists could be found
living in my town?
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I could believe that Howard Lake would have snow on the
4th of July before I would believe that!
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I decided to write to The National Library of Poetry about
my concerns. In its reply, it said, "From a group of thousands of entries,
our editorial staff chooses the top three percent of all entries as winners
of the Poet of Merit Award.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         The three percent chosen are considered semi-finalists
or fourth place winners and awarded the Editor's Choice Award."
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Needless to say, I still have the $49.95 it would cost
to have my poem published.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         In the 1996 July-August Modern Maturity magazine, there
was an article by Marvin Petal about his attempt to have a poem rejected
by The National Library of Poetry.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Petal thought the poetry contest was a scheme to separate
would-be poets from their money, so he sent them a poem by Mae B. Spurieth,
(that is a lisping version of May Be Spurious).
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         The opening lines of his poem are:
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         O'er meadows gray with bleating cows
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         And stays astir with boars and sows
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I awake athwart the mystic cranes
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         And limp sounds of bowling lanes . . . .
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Petal received the same reply I did, that he was a semi-finalist!
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         He couldn't even compose a poem so bad that it would be
rejected.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Makes you wonder what was wrong with the 97 percent of
poems that were rejected.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         Petal didn't give up. He entered the contest three more
times under the names Don B. Stewpet (as in Don't Be Stupid), Vera Stewpet,
and E. D. Yottes (Idiots).
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         In each case the reply was "Wonderful verse! Selected
for The Sound of Poetry."
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         They publish over a thousand poems every month. Can you
imagine what a gold mine they have!
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I recently received an invitation to attend the Famous
Poets Convention at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, Calif., Sept 12-14.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         The invitation stated I would receive the beautiful Diamond
Homer trophy and have a chance to read my poem in the spotlight, where I
"will flower in confidence as our family of famous poets surrounds
you with love and admiration."
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         The cost is $595 per person for convention functions, and
I must pay all other expenses. I still have my money. I'm not going.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         But they will send me a beautiful certificate acknowledging
me as a "Famous Poet for 1998" shortly after the convention.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p>
        <font size="+1">
         I still believe my poem has merit, but I will never know.
