  <p><b>PRESS BRIEFING BY <br>
    SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS</b></p>
  <p><b>The Briefing Room <br>
    </b> </p></center>
  <p>5:45 P.M. EDT<br>
  </p>
  <p> MR. HAMMER: Good afternoon. After Mr. McCurry's nice e-mail to Lockhart, 
    we will certainly try to preserve the integrity of the background briefing 
    and not reveal who it is that's going to brief you. We will have a senior 
    administration official brief on the Norway portion of the trip, and you can 
    then ask questions relating to the bilateral piece, then we'll have another 
    senior administration official come in and talk to you about the Middle East 
    peace process and those elements of the trip.</p>
  <p> So, go ahead.</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. Good afternoon. I know you've all 
    been waiting for hours to hear about the exciting bilateral piece of this 
    trip. Let me run you through that, and then one of my colleagues will be down 
    to talk about the Middle East portion in more detail.</p>
  <p> I think maybe what I'll do is just start with the schedule, if that helps, 
    and then talk a little bit about what we expect the substance to be on the 
    Norway part. And then if you've got any questions on that, I'd be happy to 
    take them.</p>
  <p> The most important thing to note from the get-go is, President Clinton's 
    trip to Norway is the first by a sitting U.S. President. And it follows a 
    very productive working visit by Prime Minister Bondevik to the White House 
    that some of you probably covered on October 15th.<br>
    <br>
    We will leave Andrews Sunday in the late afternoon. I don't have a set time 
    and I don't know that the schedule has actually been out on that yet. That 
    means trick-or-treating and Redskins have to be gotten in early. We arrive 
    Oslo Monday morning at about the time that most of my Pentagon colleagues 
    start their work day, about 7:00 a.m., give or take a little time. But there 
    will be a definite schedule on that soon, too.</p>
  <p> There's a brief pitstop at the hotel after the airport, then the President 
    begins the state visit by taking part in an arrival ceremony at the Royal 
    Palace. He'll be greeted there by King Harold. He will then place a courtesy 
    call on the King also at the palace, and that takes us to about 11:00 a.m. 
    on the Morning on Monday.<br>
    <br>
    The President then will go to meet with Prime Minister Bondevik at the Prime 
    Minister's Office. There will be some kind of press availability either before 
    or after the meeting. That isn't set yet either, I don't think.</p>
  <p> After the bilat, King Harald will host an official lunch back at the palace. 
    And the President will make a toast there, so there will be those remarks 
    as well, as will the King.</p>
  <p> Sometime Monday afternoon, or during Tuesday, I know the President hopes 
    very much to be able to see some of Oslo, but that's -- nothing is set in 
    stone, but at some point during the remainder of the trip, he'll have an opportunity 
    to do that.</p>
  <p> And let me just say that the rest of the schedule and the details on that, 
    the Middle East portion, that is the Rabin memorial and then meetings with 
    Middle Eastern leaders who will be there, will be covered by my colleague 
    who will be down in a few moments.</p>
  <p> Just a few words, if it's helpful, on what we expect substantively on the 
    bilateral piece of the trip. Well, first and foremost Middle East peace process 
    and the meeting with Prime Minister Bondevik, I think hosting next week's 
    events is just the latest in a series of important steps Norway has taken 
    to advance the Middle East peace process. <br>
    <br>
    I think all of you know, of course, that the secret meetings hosted in Oslo 
    between Israel and the PLO helped lead to the dramatic breakthrough of the 
    Declaration of Principles back in '93, and the ceremony that many of you attended 
    on the White House lawn. An impressive number of Norwegian diplomats have 
    been engaged at a very high level in advancing the Middle East peace process 
    for Norway, for the United Nations. So I expect the peace process and the 
    events of Monday and Tuesday to be the first item of business on the bilateral 
    agenda with Prime Minister Bondevik.</p>
  <p> Second item I think that's very important that will come up in their discussions 
    -- they talked about it when the Prime Minister was here -- is the Istanbul 
    OSCE summit. Norway is playing a leading role in that as the Chairman in Office 
    for 1999 of the OSCE, and as a result of that is very much in the thick of 
    things. It's played a lead role in helping to draft a new charter for the 
    OSCE. They'll probably talk about that. It's also played a key role in terms 
    of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty adaptation that will also be coming 
    up in Istanbul.</p>
  <p> OSCE also has an important role in the Balkans, so I would expect them to 
    talk about the state of play of Kosovo and also what's going on in Southeast 
    Europe, more broadly. And finally, I would expect there to be discussion about 
    Norway's cooperation with Russia on a whole host of issues, especially environmental 
    matters like nuclear waste and also probably the situation in Chechnya.</p>
  <p> The President and the Prime Minister discussed a broad range of bilateral 
    issues during their meeting a couple of weeks ago on the trade front. For 
    example, maybe they will be able to go over some more things in that area. 
    I would also expect that they'll talk about some joint initiatives they discussed 
    a couple of weeks ago to see about carrying them forward, but more details 
    on that when we get to Norway.</p>
  <p> Finally, a very quick word about the courtesy call on King Harold. He and 
    the President have a number of points in common. They both studied political 
    science. They both studied at Oxford. But perhaps most interesting for you, 
    those of you who don't know it, the most unique, both have lived in the White 
    House; the President right now, the King and his mother, Crown Princess Marta 
    spent most of the second world war in Washington, including long stretches 
    of time at the White House hosted by President Roosevelt. <br>
    <br>
    With that, I would be happy to take any of your questions on the bilateral 
    piece. </p>
  <p> Q Just to clarify, what is Norway's status in CSCE?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: OSCE? It's the Chairman in Office. There's 
    a rotating presidency of the OSCE every year, and it so happens that for 1999, 
    Norway is the president.</p>
  <p> Q Istanbul is the -- </p>
  
<p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The venue is Istanbul. <br>
  <br>
  Q Turkey is not the --</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Turkey is the host of the summit, but Norway 
    has been the working chairman, if you like, of all the workings in the OSCE 
    over the last year. Anything?</p>
  <p> Going once, going twice, and what exquisite timing.<br>
    <br>
    Q Are there any secret talks going on?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks.</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me start with the schedule as it's planned 
    currently. On Monday afternoon, after the luncheon hosted by the Norwegians, 
    the President will have two bilaterals -- first, with Prime Minister Barak, 
    lasting about an hour; and secondly, with Chairman Arafat. </p>
  <p> Then, they will have the Rabin commemorative dinner, which they will all 
    be attending. The next day, they have a second commemorative event luncheon, 
    which I think Leah Rabin will be speaking at. And after the luncheon, we're 
    planning a trilateral meeting between the President, Chairman Arafat and the 
    Prime Minister. That is scheduled for about an hour, but as you all know from 
    previous Middle East experiences, it could go longer and may well.</p>
  <p> The President, in the press conference with the Nigerian President discussed 
    the purpose of this meeting. Let me embellish a little bit on what he had 
    to say. I think there are two reasons for the President to be going to Oslo 
    at this time related to the Middle East peace process. First is, of course, 
    to commemorate Yitzhak Rabin, a hero of the peace process, a warrior for peace, 
    as the President has described him before, and a man who made a gigantic contribution 
    to the current peace process and, of course, to Israel. <br>
    <br>
    The President, as you know, has participated in previous commemorations of 
    Yitzhak Rabin and felt it very important that he be at this event as well. 
    And I think it's particularly important, given the unique role that Norway 
    played in helping bring about the breakthrough between the Israelis and the 
    Palestinians in the first place, six and a half years ago.</p>
  <p> The second purpose is, of course, to keep the process moving forward, particularly 
    as we get into the very difficult, hard issues of the endgame. Since the Wye 
    River agreement was ratified and given life again at Sharm el-Sheik a month 
    and -- almost two months ago, now, the two parties have made some important 
    progress. For example, the safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank 
    has been opened. A considerable number of Palestinian prisoners have been 
    released. And additional territory on the West Bank has been transferred to 
    Palestinian control. Security cooperation between the two parties has continued 
    to develop and get better.</p>
  <p> But now we are in the very difficult endgame discussions, with a very aggressive 
    schedule ahead of us. The parties agreed at Sharm el-Sheik that they would 
    try to reach a framework agreement on permanent status by mid-February. And 
    they've committed to an agreement on permanent status in its entirety by September 
    2000.</p>
  <p> As you all know, these deal with some of the most difficult and tough issues 
    that the parties have ever dealt with, and truly existential questions about 
    the future of Israel and the future of the Palestinian people. And the President 
    sees a good opportunity in Oslo to push that process forward.</p>
  <p> I don't anticipate any breakthroughs or any major announcements coming out 
    of Oslo. I see this as part of a process which we've been involved in in a 
    long time and this is one more very useful opportunity to push that process 
    forward.<br>
    Obviously, with the Israeli Prime Minister, we will also have the opportunity 
    to discuss a variety of other issues, including the Syrian track and trying 
    to get that started again. But I think the main focus will be on Israeli-Palestinian 
    issues. <br>
    <br>
    Why don't I stop there and take your questions.</p>
  <p> Q You made some reference to how things go when you negotiate over the Middle 
    East and one thing that almost always happens is you extend your participation, 
    like Wye for instance. The President was there, much longer than he thought 
    he would have to be. Is there any possibility that he would -- I don't know 
    what his schedule is after Oslo -- but is there any possibility, if he sees 
    the opportunity, he would stay on and keep talking?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There is no plans at this point for staying 
    on. We don't have a departure time nailed down for Tuesday night, but there 
    are no plans to stay later than that. Unlike Wye where we were trying to nail 
    down an agreement, here I think we're trying to move a process along. And 
    I don't think it's likely that that will happen.</p>
  <p> Q How would you characterize the situation now with Syria? You said that 
    is not going to be the primary focus, it will be the Palestinians and the 
    Israeli's. But it's going to be brought up ,I assume, by the Israeli Prime 
    Minister. What is the situation? Do we perceive a desire there, a continued 
    desire on the part of Syria that -- for some movement here?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We believe both the Israelis and the Syrians 
    do want to try find a way to get back to the negotiating table, but have been 
    stymied so far by an inability to agree upon the spot with which those negations 
    would start. There continues to be a very active engagement by us in trying 
    to see if we can't find a formula to get them going. And I would suspect that 
    the Prime Minister and the President will talk about that some more in Oslo. 
    But as you said, I don't think that will be the main focal point of their 
    discussions.</p>
  <p> Q Can you just expand a little bit more on what this opportunity is that 
    the President sees for pushing the process ahead?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The parties have, since Oslo, been engaged 
    in interim agreements, and Wye and Sharm el-Sheik were, in many ways, a continuation 
    of the process of interim agreements. That process is now moving ahead and 
    we are achieving success on the ground.<br>
    <br>
    The next major step is to reach a framework agreement on the permanent status, 
    and that is the hardest problem of them all, because you're going to have 
    to deal with issues like boundaries, final status of territory, Jerusalem, 
    refugees, settlements -- all of those issues. </p>
  <p> Those are huge, tough nuts to crack, and they won't be cracked in an afternoon, 
    but they are now the issues that are very much on the agenda, and he wants 
    to take advantage of this opportunity to meet with the two of them to push 
    that process along.<br>
    <br>
    Q Do you think February is realistic?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The parties, themselves, have set that date 
    and we certainly want to do everything we can to try and make it happen.<br>
    <br>
    Q What other foreign leaders will be there? And also, why is there a major 
    commemoration for Rabin? It's the fourth anniversary of his assassination, 
    is that right?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's correct.</p>
  <p> Q So why now? Why not in the fifth year, or the first? Is there some reason 
    why it's happening this time?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think you'd have to ask the Norwegians 
    why they chose this time. We think it's particularly useful to do so, but 
    it was the Norwegians who picked this particular time and place.</p>
  <p> Q And what other foreign leaders are going to be there?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't have a complete list of all the 
    foreign leaders who are going to be there. I know that in my part of the world, 
    it will be Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat.</p>
  <p> Q You mean Egypt and Jordan are not coming?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Egypt and Jordan will not be represented 
    at the leader level.</p>
  <p> Q They will send lower-level officials?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's correct.</p>
  <p> Q Is that disappointing? You extolled those two as being great moderates 
    and very helpful in promoting peace. You're also looking to Egypt to help 
    multilaterally. Aren't you disappointed?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I don't think we're disappointed, because 
    we did recently have a meeting at which the leaders were at, at Sharm el-Sheik. 
    For their own reasons, they're not coming, but I think that our confidence 
    level that Egypt and Jordan will continue to be part of the team pushing for 
    peace breakthroughs continues to be very high.</p>
  <p> Q Is there anything specific the United States can do, in addition to what 
    it's done before, to move the process forward?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think one of the most important things 
    we can do is live up to the commitments that we made at Wye to fund the process 
    of peace. And as you know, the President has been pressing the Congress to 
    provide the funding for the Wye River agreements, which was not in the bill 
    that he vetoed. If there's one particular issue, I think that's it. </p>
  <p> Q So what does he say to Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak about 
    that? Sorry, we'd like to help you out, but the Congress isn't playing ball?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He said that he's working on it, and he 
    will keep working on it, and he intends to live up to the commitments he has 
    made.<br>
    <br>
    Q Do I understand what you were saying, that it's not going to be a big priority, 
    the Syrian track is on the back burner now?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I wouldn't say the track is on the back 
    burner. What I would say is that what we have is a meeting in Oslo at which 
    Israelis and Palestinians are at. There are no Syrians there, so clearly, 
    the main focus of those conversations is going to be about their track. </p>
  <p> Q I'm talking about the President meeting with Barak. That's one on one, 
    which -- </p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And as I said, I expect the Syrian track 
    will be part of their discussion.</p>
  <p> Q Can I take you up on that? Mr. Rabin, who you revere often --</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Rightly.</p>
  <p> Q Well, he said, remember -- but that was, of course, years ago and things 
    change -- that he didn't think the Israeli people could digest a Syrian agreement 
    and a Palestinian agreement at the same time. You know the reasons why -- 
    it's more than you could expect them to handle. The administration now is 
    of the view, I suppose, that it's manageable. The Israeli public and -- of 
    course, you're pushing for territorial withdrawal on every front you can -- 
    the administration feels that the Israeli public can take it in stride and 
    things have changed that much?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The Prime Minister has said that he wants 
    to move on both tracks with a very aggressive calendar. He's outlined not 
    only the calendar I talked about on the Palestinian track, but he's said that 
    he wants to have an agreement which would allow withdrawal of Israeli forces 
    from Lebanon by the middle of next year, and he would also like to reach an 
    agreement with the Syrians by next year.</p>
  <p> Q Yes, but what I'm driving at is, why the track is cold.</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It is his judgment that he can do both.</p>
  <p> Q Yes, but I'm trying to -- I should have put the question differently. 
    What I'm driving at is, the track is not in action right now, and I'm wondering, 
    there's got to be a reason for it. Israeli -- some notion that the Israelis 
    don't think they give you both at the same time; Syria being a little bit 
    reluctant; or the U.S. thinking maybe too much is too much?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: None of the above. I think it is because 
    it has been hard to find a way to get the process moving again. Our sense 
    is, both Prime Minister Barak and President Assad would like to get that track 
    energized. And I can assure you the President would like to get that track 
    energized.</p>
  <p> Q Will Syria be represented at any level at Oslo?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't believe so.</p>
  <p> Q At any level at all?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not 100 percent sure, but I don't believe 
    so.</p>
  <p> Q Were they invited?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You'd have to ask the Norwegians that.</p>
  
<p> Q Could you answer a question about implementation of Wye? Will the President 
  try to move to clean up the Wye River accords, as far as implementation is concerned 
  -- the further redeployment, the third withdrawal, and the port, and the second 
  crossing, et cetera, et cetera? There's a whole bunch of things that are still 
  on the table outside of the framework. Will this be one of the --<br>
  <br>
  SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm sure they will have a chance, both in the 
  bilaterals and the trilateral, to take stock of the progress they've made. And 
  there are issues that remain to be done. And not surprisingly, not everything 
  has been done to the letter of the timetable that was agreed at Sharm. But our 
  impression is, we are basically on the right track, and we are moving forward.</p>
<p> There has been one withdrawal from territory, for example. Another one is 
    scheduled to take place, I think, within the next two weeks. And I think we 
    have every reason to believe that will be on track. So I think there will 
    be a stock-taking, but not with a sense of disappointment at what's happened, 
    but with a sense of, you know, we're making progress, we need to continue 
    to implement the agreement.</p>
  <p> Q Given the possible disappointments of Jordan and Egypt not attending notwithstanding, 
    does the agreement between Israel and Mauritania today to establish diplomatic 
    relations, does that provide at least a modest psychological boost to the 
    peace process?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that any time the circle of peace 
    is widened and Israel's relations with her Arab neighbors get deeper is a 
    positive step forward. That is why we welcomed the announcement between Israel 
    and Mauritania. And again, just for the record, I was not disappointed about 
    Egypt and Jordan. I think we continue to see them as very much active players 
    in pushing this process forward whether or not President Mubarak and King 
    Abdallah were able to make it to Oslo.</p>
  <p> Q What Arab nations then will be represented, even at any level?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I just don't have a complete list for you. 
    I know that it will be -- that Egypt and Jordan will have representatives 
    there, but I don't have a complete list for you.</p>
  <p> Q -- the money that you need from Congress to implement the Wye Accord. 
    Can you talk about exactly how that money would be spent?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In the case of the Palestinians the money 
    goes for economic programs, all very much targeted to specific different kinds 
    of infrastructure programs. In the case of Israel it is primarily for assistance 
    in the security field, particularly in helping Israel to absorb the costs 
    of redeploying forces on the West Bank.</p>
  <p> Q And how much money is -- </p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: In the case of Jordan it's -- I think it's 
    also economic, primarily economic assistance.</p>
  <p> Q What's the sum of money that the President is seeking that he didn't get?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's $1.2 billion for Israel, $400 million 
    for the Palestinians and $300 million for Jordan.</p>
  <p> Q Jordan?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: For Jordan, right? Over three years.</p>
  <p> Q You've largely ruled out any kind of extension of the President's stay 
    in Oslo. There has been some speculation that there might be a Middle East 
    coefficient when the President goes to Turkey, that he might go down, for 
    instance and make a trip to Damascus. Any possibility of that that you know 
    of?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are no plans at this time for additional 
    trips.</p>
  <p> Q Would he be willing to do it, would he be willing to do it if that was 
    the linchpin of it to get Syria in?</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All I would say on that is, as you know, 
    that trip has already got quite a number of stops in it, and as far as I know, 
    there are no plans for additional stops.</p>
  <p> Q You wouldn't rule it out? As you know, the Syrians have said --</p>
  <p> SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: One of the things I learned about Middle 
    East politics a long time ago is, I don't rule out anything, but there are 
    no plans for additional stops at this time.</p>
  <p> THE PRESS: Thank you.</p>
