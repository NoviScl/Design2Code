								by Steve Ashley, M.S., M.L.S., ARM<br>

								<br>
								One of the most difficult law enforcement 
								activities to manage is that of motor vehicle 
								pursuit. Each year in the United States, several 
								hundred persons (including some police officers) 
								are killed, and many others are injured during 
								the course of pursuits. Pursuit-related 
								accidents, injuries and deaths cause significant 
								emotional distress for officers, and frequently 
								result in very negative public relations for 
								departments. Occasionally, officers are 
								criminally prosecuted following pursuit-related 
								crashes. Of course, one of the most common 
								negative outcomes of pursuit is litigation 
								arising from the attendant crashes, injuries 
								and/or deaths. Clearly, both street officers and 
								police managers need to take steps to reduce the 
								risks inherent in motor vehicle pursuits.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Key Terms</b><br>
								<br>
								Motor Vehicle Pursuit – The act of attempting 
								apprehension of a fleeing vehicle, once the 
								operator has given some indication of his or her 
								intent not to stop or yield. This indication can 
								be by increasing speed, bypassing traffic 
								control devices, or other means.<br>
								<br>
								Resistive Behavior – Negative behavior exhibited 
								by an individual after an officer has indicated 
								intent to control the individual. The negative 
								behavior can be psychologically or physically 
								intimidating actions or words, passive refusal 
								to cooperate, or active resistance 
								(physical)—including the use of weapons.<br>
								<br>
								Reasonableness – That which another person or 
								officer, with similar training, would do under 
								similar circumstances.<br>
								<br>
								Constitutional Deprivation – Government actions 
								that are contrary to the rights and assurances 
								granted by the Constitution of the United 
								States. Deprivations may be either reasonable or 
								unreasonable.<br>
								<br>
								Resistance/Control Continuum – A graphic 
								representation of the relationship between 
								levels of resistance and levels of control. 
								Sometimes referred to as a “Use of Force 
								Continuum”.<br>
								<br>
								Public Harm Risk – The degree of risk to the 
								public posed by the actions of a suspect, 
								usually equated with the initial act that gives 
								rise to a pursuit. Generally comprised of two 
								elements: the risk inherent in the initial act 
								or crime committed by the suspect, and the risk 
								faced by the public should the suspect be 
								allowed to escape and remain at large. This is 
								different that the degree of risk to the public 
								posed by the pursuit itself.<br>
								<br>
								Pursuit Management Continuum – A specific type 
								of Resistance/Control Continuum, reflecting the 
								relationship between pursuit causation factors 
								and the tactics and techniques that may 
								reasonably be used in the apprehension of a 
								fleeing suspect.<br>
								<br>
								Initial Interaction – Techniques that represent 
								a relatively low risk of injury to officers and 
								the public. Often naturally occurring, these 
								techniques do not require any special resources 
								or personnel.<br>
								<br>
								Active Intervention – Techniques that require 
								additional personnel, specialized equipment or 
								training, and/or advanced planning. These 
								tactics represent a greater degree of risk to 
								officers and the public. Additionally, these 
								techniques usually constitute “seizures” under 
								the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<br>
								<br>
								Critical Interdiction – Techniques the represent 
								the greatest degree of risk to officers. These 
								techniques approach the use of deadly force, and 
								should only be undertaken when high levels of 
								control are necessary.<br>
								<br>
								<b>REDUCING THE RISKS OF POLICE PURSUIT</b><br>
								<br>
								Consider this: You’re working midnights. It’s a 
								couple of hours past the time you usually get 
								your nightly “drunk driver arrest”, but it’s a 
								slow night, so you’re doing some property 
								checks. Suddenly, a vehicle coming toward you on 
								a quiet residential street swerves up over the 
								curb, and knocks down a string of mailboxes, 
								continuing on. You turn around, and attempt to 
								stop the swaying, slow moving vehicle. Instead 
								of pulling over to the right, the driver 
								accelerates, and turns down a side street. You 
								notify dispatch, and begin to pursue.<br>
								<br>
								Both your emergency lights and siren are 
								operating, but the bad guy’s ignoring them. As 
								the vehicle begins to come into the downtown 
								area, early morning commuters are out and about. 
								The fleeing vehicle swerves through the traffic, 
								narrowly missing several vehicles and one 
								pedestrian. Your heart’s pounding, because you 
								realize that if the vehicle gets into the 
								congestion of morning traffic, there’s likely to 
								be an accident.<br>
								<br>
								You can see vehicles stopped at a red light up 
								ahead, but the fleeing vehicle doesn’t seem to 
								be slowing down. You know that he doesn’t have 
								room to get through, but that doesn’t seem to 
								matter to the bad guy. You see an opportunity to 
								ram the vehicle off the road before he hurts 
								someone, but you’re not sure if you should take 
								it. While you’re trying to decide on your next 
								move, a vehicle backs out of a driveway, 
								directly into the path of the fleeing violator. 
								There is a loud crash, and both vehicles spin 
								out of control into a bus-stop full of morning 
								commuters. . . .<br>
								<br>
								Its three hours later and you’re sitting in the 
								Squad Room, trying to do your report. As your 
								mind runs over the events of the pursuit, you 
								begin to wonder whether you did the right thing, 
								but you can’t quite see how you could have 
								responded any differently. After all, he decided 
								to run, didn’t he? You were just doing your job.
								<br>
								<br>
								Wouldn’t it be great, you think to yourself, if 
								there was a more concrete way to figure these 
								things out before things blew up in your face?<br>
								<br>
								A police officer that engages in the pursuit of 
								a motor vehicle participates in one of the most 
								hazardous of all police duties. Pursuit has been 
								vilified by plaintiff’s attorneys and the media 
								as irresponsible, reckless and unnecessarily 
								dangerous, while at the same time the practice 
								is defended by police officers as necessary for 
								the apprehension of many suspects that are 
								unwilling to immediately yield to an officer’s 
								signal to stop. Police administrators are caught 
								in the middle, wanting to provide essential 
								options for their officers, while meeting their 
								obligation to direct and control a potentially 
								hazardous activity.<br>
								<br>
								The practice of vehicular pursuit is fraught 
								with contradictions, and is therefore difficult 
								to manage both administratively and 
								operationally. There are many aspects of pursuit 
								that must be considered and weighed prior to, 
								during, and immediately following the actual 
								occurrence of a pursuit. Each of these aspects 
								harbors the potential for different 
								interpretations by various elements of society.<br>
								<br>
								For example, it is not uncommon for a police 
								administrator to state in writing that his 
								department’s policy is to never allow a pursuit 
								to be hazardous to officers or citizens. 
								Generally the same policy document calls for the 
								immediate abandonment of any pursuit that rises 
								to the level of “hazardous”. However, from a 
								practical standpoint, most pursuits involve 
								various hazardous elements, such as speed in 
								excess of the posted limit, or disobedience of 
								traffic control devices.<br>

								<font face="Arial">
								<br>
								When this situation occurs, officers are put in 
								the position of either deciding to never pursue, 
								or of violating the policy statements of the 
								department. Neither of these alternatives is 
								satisfactory, and both present different types 
								of risk for the agency. Failing to pursue 
								violators could give rise to charges of failure 
								to perform the mission of the department, while 
								violation of the department’s policies subjects 
								the officer to disciplinary action—and the 
								department to potential litigation.<br>
								<br>
								Obviously, it is necessary to develop a 
								different approach to this and other pursuit 
								issues.<br>
								<br>
								<b>PURSUIT AS FORCE</b><br>
								<br>
								Whenever a law enforcement officer uses force to 
								control resistive behavior, the legal system 
								will attempt to answer two questions. Of these, 
								the most fundamental is whether or not there was 
								an appropriate and reasonable balance between 
								the degree to which society would be exposed to 
								harm should the force not be used and the degree 
								of harm to society inherent in the level of 
								force used. <br>
								<br>
								The system will also attempt to determine if the 
								officer’s use of force resulted in an 
								unreasonable constitutional deprivation. In 
								order to answer this question, a two-tiered test 
								will be applied.<br>
								<br>
								First, the Court will determine if an actual 
								constitutional deprivation occurred. In other 
								words, was there a seizure through the mechanism 
								of force? If so, the Court will examine the 
								seizure to determine if it was reasonable. This 
								test will go beyond an examination of the 
								justification for the use of force, and will 
								also look at the degree of force that was used.<br>
								<br>
								This balance test, and the evaluation of the 
								degree and reasonableness of any constitutional 
								deprivation apply to any use of force by a law 
								enforcement officer. Increasingly, they are 
								being applied to the conduct of police pursuits, 
								as well. While there is no existing legal 
								definition of pursuit as force, per se, it is 
								clear that many aspects of a police pursuit 
								verge on the use of force, and many times the 
								outcome of a pursuit is similar to the outcome 
								of a physical use of force.<br>
								<br>
								Police officers use force to control resistive 
								behavior, and to gain control of individuals for 
								the purpose of taking them into custody. This is 
								frequently what occurs during a pursuit. A 
								pursuit involves the use of a vehicle in order 
								to capture and control a resistive individual, 
								and once that individual is controlled, they are 
								usually taken into custody.<br>
								<br>
								Some tactics utilized to bring a pursuit to a 
								satisfactory conclusion involve physically 
								blocking the path of the fleeing vehicle, or 
								even striking the fleeing vehicle with a police 
								vehicle. The parallel between these tactics and 
								other types of force is unmistakable.<br>
								<br>
								Many of the tactics commonly employed by police 
								officers during a pursuit contain some vestige 
								of force. While this force is present to a 
								greater or lesser degree, depending on the 
								tactic used, the use of any generally accepted 
								technique or method of pursuit presents a degree 
								of risk consistent with the amount of force 
								being used.<br>
								<br>
								<b>STANDARDS FOR PURSUIT</b><br>
								<br>
								One of the most significant problems faced by 
								administrators in their attempts to manage 
								pursuit is the lack of applicable standards and 
								terminology. The United States Supreme Court has 
								provided guidelines for the use of force , and 
								the use of deadly force , but has not provided 
								clear standards and guidelines for police 
								pursuit. Some States have case law on the 
								subject of pursuit , but of course that case law 
								is not binding on other States.<br>
								<br>
								There have been some notable attempts to provide 
								guidelines for pursuit training , but these 
								attempts have generally focused on the 
								organizational details of driver training 
								programs, and have not focused on pursuit 
								itself. If pursuit is addressed at all, it is as 
								one limited aspect of an overall training 
								program.<br>
								<br>
								In order to provide a systematic approach to the 
								management of police pursuit, it is necessary to 
								develop and utilize a continuum similar to those 
								developed for management of the use of force. 
								Such a Pursuit Management Continuum© can be 
								utilized to show the relationship between the 
								degree of threat posed to the general public by 
								vehicles engaging in different types of pursuit, 
								and the tactics and techniques typically used by 
								police officers to control those pursuits.<br>
								<br>
								Additionally, a pursuit continuum can be 
								utilized to indicate the escalation and 
								de-escalation of force and control inherent in 
								various techniques, and the degree of exposure 
								to risk presented by each, particularly in the 
								areas of officer injury and the potential 
								violation of civil rights.<br>
								<br>
								Lastly, a pursuit continuum can offer a graphic 
								representation of levels of resistive behavior 
								(Types of Pursuit) and levels of control. This 
								will aid officers and their departments in 
								classifying pursuits and pursuit control 
								techniques so as to make them more operationally 
								specific.<br>
								<br>
								<b>PUBLIC HARM AND REASONABLENESS</b><br>
								<br>
								The most critical element of any pursuit is the 
								need to match the level of control exerted to 
								the degree of risk posed by the fleeing 
								individual. In other words, what is the degree 
								of risk posed to the public by the offense 
								committed by the individual, and what is the 
								degree of risk posed to the public should the 
								fleeing individual make good his or her escape, 
								and be free to commit the offense again?<br>
								<br>
								This public harm risk is different than the 
								degree of risk posed by the pursuit itself. Most 
								pursuits involve dangerous activities by their 
								very nature. While some are less hazardous than 
								others, the very act of engaging in motor 
								vehicle pursuit involves vehicular operation 
								outside the generally accepted parameters 
								established for normal vehicle movement and 
								control.<br>
								<br>
								At issue is the reasonableness of an officer’s 
								actions in pursuing a fleeing violator. If an 
								officer’s actions are reasonable in light of the 
								public harm risk that exists, then the officer’s 
								actions should be defensible in a court of law.<br>
								<br>
								<b>A PURSUIT MANAGEMENT CONTINUUM</b><br>
								<br>
								The use of such a Pursuit Management Continuum 
								must be based on several fundamental concepts:<br>
								<br>
								• Officer’s can disengage from pursuit, or 
								de-escalate the control mechanisms being used, 
								at any time they reasonably believe it to be 
								necessary.<br>
								<br>
								• Control alternatives presuppose proper 
								utilization of the tactics, based on reasonable 
								decision-making on the part of officers and 
								supervisors, not the worst possible result 
								scenario. While its possible to envision a 
								scenario where lethal harm results from the 
								application of lower level control methods, it 
								is not the officer’s intended result. Therefore, 
								the actual outcome should have nothing to do 
								with the reasonableness or unreasonableness of 
								an officer’s actions, given that the technique 
								or tactic was properly and judiciously applied.<br>
								<br>
								Just as one should not place firearms low on a 
								use of force continuum, based on the fact that 
								most shots fired by officers miss, and therefore 
								there is no harm—one should not place stationary 
								roadblocks high on the Pursuit Management 
								Continuum because a suspect may choose to ram 
								the roadblock, and die in the attempt.<br>
								<br>
								• Escalation and de-escalation on the Continuum 
								is keyed to the level of pursuit causation 
								factor at work. Additionally, officers must 
								evaluate the totality of the circumstances in 
								which they find themselves, when making 
								decisions regarding the use of any control or 
								force option.<br>
								<br>
								Just as an officer should not use deadly force 
								against a suspect who has indicated an intent to 
								surrender, and who does not offer an immediate 
								threat of serious harm to anyone—an officer 
								should not implement a high level control option 
								against an individual who may have started a 
								pursuit by committing a life threatening act, 
								but is now apparently slowing as if to stop.<br>
								<br>
								• Officers should stay at, or below, the control 
								level that matches the pursuit level (i.e. Level 
								Two pursuit, Level Two Control). It should be 
								the suspect’s actions in escalating the pursuit 
								level that prompts the officer to escalate the 
								control level utilized.<br>
								<br>
								• Decisions regarding the use of particular 
								pursuit control tactics should not be based 
								solely on the likely liability exposure, but 
								should give significant consideration to the 
								degree of risk faced by the involved officers. 
								Officers should only utilize tactics and 
								techniques with which they have been trained.<br>
								<br>
								<b>PURSUIT AND CONTROL</b><br>
								<br>
								The degree of public harm risk can be classified 
								at three levels, as can the techniques and 
								tactics utilized to control pursuits. Generally 
								speaking, pursuits at a certain level reasonably 
								justify use of control techniques from the 
								corresponding control level (i.e. Level One 
								Pursuit - Level One Control).<br>
								<br>
								The various control techniques can be grouped as 
								to their general traits and common elements.<br>
								<br>
								Initial Interaction Techniques -- Largely 
								because of body alarm response (sometimes 
								referred to as “Fight or Flight Syndrome”), 
								these techniques can be naturally occurring—that 
								is, they may occur without the officer intending 
								to use them. It is not uncommon for officers to 
								use a reduced interval, or to swing out to one 
								side or the other (Pursuit Position), in their 
								desire to capture the fleeing suspect. While 
								they may be natural in some cases, officers must 
								guard against the tendency to allow these 
								techniques to be applied to excess. Reduced 
								interval trailing can easily become dangerous 
								tail-gating, and the Pursuit Position can lead 
								to pulling alongside, thereby exposing the 
								officers to heightened hazards.<br>
								<br>
								Active Intervention Techniques – These control 
								techniques are not naturally occurring. Active 
								Intervention Techniques require physical 
								intervention by officers. They therefore 
								typically require the presence of specialized 
								equipment, more than one police vehicle, or 
								advanced planning.<br>
								<br>
								Critical Interdiction Techniques – These higher 
								risk techniques constitute the use of potential 
								or actual deadly force. They possess the same 
								traits as Active Intervention Techniques, with 
								the added caveat that they place the officers in 
								significant physical peril.<br>

								<b>Level One Pursuit/Level One Control</b><br>
								<br>
								A Level One Pursuit is a pursuit initiated to 
								apprehend an individual fleeing after committing 
								a simple traffic offense or a less serious 
								crime. Generally, such offenses as vandalism, 
								minor theft, and disorderly conduct, while 
								misdemeanors, are considered to present a low 
								degree of risk to the public. Pursuit for these 
								offenses can be justified, yet many of the more 
								hazardous pursuit tactics should not be used, 
								due to the minimal potential for public harm 
								posed by the offense. Techniques and tactics 
								that are generally acceptable in these instances 
								are:<br>
								<br>
								Trailing -- The simple act of following along 
								behind the violator while giving both visual and 
								audible indication that the violator should 
								stop, and advising dispatch and other units of 
								the violator’s location and actions. Care should 
								be taken to maintain a safe interval between the 
								violator’s vehicle and the police vehicle.<br>
								<br>
								Pursuit Position (Offset) -- Moving the police 
								vehicle approximately one half vehicle width to 
								either side (similar to the position 
								traditionally taken when parking during a 
								traffic stop), while continuing to Trail. This 
								offset position allows the officer to see 
								oncoming traffic, and to expose emergency 
								warning lights to the view of oncoming vehicles. 
								It should also allow the officer to more readily 
								anticipate the violator’s actions, due to the 
								enhanced visibility offered by the position. 
								Lastly, when approaching an intersection, the 
								offset position may allow the officer to 
								encourage the violator to turn in the desired 
								direction.<br>
								<br>
								Reduced Interval -- More closely following the 
								violator, either while trailing or while 
								utilizing the pursuit position. While this 
								technique can present greater risk of collision, 
								it does facilitate greater visibility of the 
								violator’s vehicle and its occupants. It can 
								also be utilized to apply psychological 
								pressure.<br>
								<br>
								Controlled Deflation Devices – When a department 
								has equipped and trained officers in the use of 
								these devices (sometimes called “spike strips”), 
								such equipment can be deployed as a method for 
								establishing a relatively low risk “roadblock”. 
								Officers should take care to plan adequately 
								when selecting a location for deployment, and 
								should move a safe distance from the deployment 
								zone.<br>
								<br>
								Stationary Road Block -- The placement of one or 
								more police vehicles in the traveled portion of 
								the roadway, in order to partially block the 
								road, and to indicate a denial of passage to the 
								violator’s vehicle. Although not absolutely 
								necessary, officers frequently leave a 
								restricted route through the roadblock. When the 
								road is totally blocked, so that even a slow 
								moving vehicle cannot go around—or 
								through—safely, the degree of risk is 
								heightened. When a complete blockage of the 
								roadway is undertaken, officers should ensure 
								that the oncoming suspect has a clear view of 
								the roadblock, and has ample time to stop 
								safely, should he or she decide to do so. This 
								complete blockage usually represents a higher 
								level of control, and could be constitutionally 
								unreasonable unless properly managed.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Level Two Pursuit/Level Two Control</b><br>
								<br>
								Level two pursuits are those which are initiated 
								for very hazardous traffic offenses, such as 
								driving while intoxicated or reckless driving, 
								or for more serious crimes, such as assault. 
								Level two pursuits are initiated for offenses 
								that present a high level of danger to the 
								public, but not such a high level of danger that 
								deadly force is routinely justified in the 
								apprehension attempt. Techniques and tactics 
								that are generally acceptable in these instances 
								are:<br>
								<br>
								Rolling Road Block -- The placement of one or 
								more police vehicles in the path of the 
								violator’s vehicle, in order to cause it to slow 
								and/or stop. This is sometimes done by one 
								vehicle, swerving back and forth from lane to 
								lane (difficult, as it requires anticipation of 
								the violator’s movements), and sometimes by two 
								or three vehicles, moving along the highway in 
								echelon or abreast.<br>
								<br>
								Boxing In -- A technique whereby two or more 
								police units move into positions around the 
								fleeing vehicle, forming a “box”. Once the box 
								is formed, all police vehicles slow, causing the 
								violator in the box to slow as well. Because 
								Boxing In, or “channeling” as it is sometimes 
								called, requires the placement of one or more 
								police vehicles in the path of the violator’s 
								vehicle, it is considered a form of Rolling Road 
								Block.<br>
								<br>
								Controlled Contact -- Intentional contact 
								between a police vehicle and the violator’s 
								vehicle. Generally, Controlled Contact is 
								undertaken at lower speeds, and is frequently 
								intended to cause the violator to spin out of 
								control or to leave the roadway in a slow, but 
								uncontrolled manner. While this is the intended 
								result, Controlled Contact collisions are 
								sometimes unpredictable, and may be viewed as a 
								form of Ramming by the legal system. They 
								therefore involve application of potentially 
								deadly force. One technique that has been 
								developed to attempt to allow for safer 
								Controlled Contact collisions is the Precision 
								Immobilization Technique, or PIT Maneuver. The 
								use of such techniques calls for training, 
								planning, opportunity, and careful timing.<br>
								<br>
								Level two control techniques are more aggressive 
								in nature, and call for police vehicles to move 
								in front of a fleeing violator. For this reason, 
								they are more hazardous to the officers, and 
								require time to plan, develop and execute.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Level Three Pursuit/Level Three Control</b><br>
								<br>
								Level three pursuits are those initiated 
								following the commission of life threatening 
								felonies that usually justify the use of deadly 
								force in the apprehension of the fleeing 
								violator. Examples include armed robbery, 
								assault with a deadly weapon, and murder. 
								Techniques and tactics that are generally 
								acceptable in these instances are:<br>
								<br>
								Uncontrolled Contact – Sometimes referred to as 
								“Ramming”. This represents a higher level of 
								intentional contact between a police vehicle and 
								a violator’s vehicle. Uncontrolled Contact is 
								frequently attempted at higher speeds than 
								intentional collisions. Because it is so 
								unpredictable, Uncontrolled Contact presents a 
								high degree of risk to the officers involved, 
								and may constitute deadly force, depending on 
								the circumstances of the incident.<br>
								<br>
								Use of Firearms – There are some situations 
								where firing a weapon at a fleeing violator may 
								be necessary in the immediate defense of the 
								officer or another. In most cases, however, this 
								is generally not good practice, due to the low 
								likelihood of success, and the hazard posed to 
								the public by missed shots. Additionally, if a 
								bullet should strike the violator, his vehicle 
								is now pilotless, and presents a significant 
								hazard in and of itself. If the violator is not 
								alone in the vehicle, then passengers against 
								whom deadly force may be inappropriate are put 
								at great risk. While some recent court decisions 
								have indicated that police officers do not owe a 
								duty to passengers in a fleeing vehicle, this is 
								by no means clear in every jurisdiction.<br>
								<br>
								Level three control techniques can be extremely 
								hazardous to the officers that attempt them, and 
								should only be utilized in emergency situations, 
								where a human life is already at great risk. In 
								essence, level three control techniques are 
								almost indistinguishable from the use of deadly 
								force, and therefore officers who are going to 
								use them should ask themselves if the death of 
								the violator is acceptable as an outcome to the 
								event. If the answer is anything but an 
								unqualified yes, then the control technique 
								should not be used.<br>
								<br>
								<b>UTILIZATION OF THE CONTINUUM</b><br>
								<br>
								There are three primary uses for the Pursuit 
								Management Continuum; policy development, 
								training, and supervision.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Policy Development and Support</b><br>
								<br>
								The Pursuit Management Continuum contains a 
								classification system for pursuit causation 
								activities which, if incorporated into a 
								department’s policy, can be utilized as an aid 
								to decision-making on the part of street 
								officers and supervisors. <br>
								<br>
								Additionally, key elements of policy can be 
								linked to the classification system. For 
								example, it is fairly common for a department to 
								restrict by policy the number of police vehicles 
								that may engage in a pursuit. The theory is that 
								the fewer vehicles there are involved, the lower 
								the risk and therefore the lower the liability 
								exposure.<br>
								<br>
								However, this does not take into account the 
								nature of the pursuit causation or the number of 
								suspects involved. Restricting a pursuit of 
								three armed robbery suspects to two single 
								officer patrol units may be safer for the 
								motoring public, but it is not safer for the 
								officers.<br>
								<br>
								Departmental policy should indicate that the 
								nature of the pursuit causation should be 
								considered when controlling the number of units 
								in a pursuit. By classifying the pursuit as a 
								Level Three pursuit, with multiple suspects, a 
								safe number of police units and officers can be 
								assigned to the pursuit.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Training</b><br>
								<br>
								Utilization of the Pursuit Management Continuum 
								as a training aid can assist in linking the 
								concept of escalation/de-escalation of control 
								methods to the conduct of a police pursuit. 
								Additionally, the relationship between the 
								pursuit causation factors (the previously 
								mentioned public harm risk) and the techniques 
								that are reasonable and proper should become 
								more obvious to officers.<br>
								<br>
								The Continuum can also be used to illustrate the 
								increase in Officer Injury Potential that is 
								inherent in escalation through pursuit control 
								levels. As officers begin to take more 
								aggressive actions to attempt the apprehension 
								of a violator, they increase the degree of risk 
								to themselves.<br>
								<br>
								Lastly, the Continuum can be used to explain the 
								potential civil rights ramifications of 
								escalation through the various pursuit control 
								levels. As each succeeding level is utilized, 
								the degree of intrusion into the suspect’s 
								existence increases. While this increasing 
								invasiveness may be reasonable and proper under 
								the circumstances, it still may give rise to 
								questions regarding potential civil rights 
								violations.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Supervision</b><br>
								<br>
								The vague descriptions of pursuit activity that 
								are commonly used during radio transmissions 
								could be replaced with the descriptive Pursuit 
								Levels. Once this is done, then all parties 
								involved would be aware of the acceptable 
								techniques. The enhanced ability to communicate 
								causation factors and approved techniques will 
								eliminate some of the confusion that typically 
								surrounds police pursuit radio communications.<br>
								<br>
								An example of supervisory application of the 
								Continuum might involve a Level Two Pursuit 
								through heavy traffic or some other type of high 
								risk environment. Supervisory personnel may 
								choose to limit the officers to Control Level 
								One, and so advise them. Use of the control 
								levels makes direction clear and concise.<br>
								<br>
								Utilization of the Continuum provides a series 
								of benchmarks for the supervision and direction 
								of pursuits by the first-line supervisor. By 
								utilizing these benchmarks, the supervisor can 
								more successfully manage the conduct of pursuits 
								by officers, while at the same time, more 
								accurately evaluate the performance of officers 
								engaging in pursuit.<br>
								<br>
								<b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
								<br>
								Police pursuit as it is currently practiced in 
								the United States is a relatively dangerous, 
								inexact undertaking. Officers, violators and the 
								public are frequently at considerable risk even 
								when management control measures are attempted. 
								Current methods of managing pursuits are 
								cumbersome and difficult to utilize. 
								Communication during pursuits is hampered by the 
								lack of a system for classification of pursuit 
								causation factors, and the reasonable 
								relationship of those factors to available 
								control techniques.<br>
								<br>
								Implementation of the Pursuit Management 
								Continuum should allow many of these 
								difficulties to be controlled. Reasonable 
								application of pursuit control techniques, as 
								described in the various control levels of the 
								Continuum, should help to manage the potential 
								for officer injury or litigation arising from 
								police pursuit activity.</font></p>
