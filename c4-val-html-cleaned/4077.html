   What is your Landfill Budget?

      A major problem faced by most municipalities in Canada is the disposal of material in
landfills. Incredibly, Canadians throw out
more garbage per capita than any other country on the planet! But,
the political mayhem produced by NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) activists makes the
subject so untouchable politically that most city councils are simply dysfunctional on the
issue, even cities such as Ottawa with its huge areas suitable for landfills.
      <p>
       From a sustainability perspective, landfills have become worse not better with
regulation. Sustainability is putting things back where we found them, and landfills
are now meticulously designed to prevent that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you know how much you are sending to landfills, and how you compare with
others? Here's how to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Statistics Canada the average Canadian sends 300&nbsp;kg per year to
landfills as residential waste. So, to start, simply weigh each bag of your residential garbage for a while on
your bathroom scale, then divide by the number of people in your household.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, ask how you can reduce this. The answer almost certainly is, a lot!

      You can do it too! Here's how.
      <p>
       The three R's of garbage are Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Reduce
      </h4>
      <p>
       To start taking action towards environmental responsibility, translate Reduce as
'Refuse'. Whenever anyone offers you anything that will end up in landfill, try
to say, "No".
      </p>
      <p>
       Single-use bags are an easy place to start. Make or buy a few heavy fabric shopping
bags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plastic bags are not only light weight, but can be reused easily for storing food
in a frig, a cupboard, or in school lunches. Large bags serve to contain landfill
garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get used to the truth about recycling paper, that half of it ends up in landfills. Paper is not just trees, it's plasticisers for wet strength and clays for smooth
surfaces as well.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Reuse
      </h4>
      <p>
       To begin, translate Reuse as 'Repair'. Whenever anyone offers you anything that can't
be repaired when a minor thing breaks, look for another product.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you can't reuse something that still works, offer it to someone else. Might those no longer
worn clothes or old sofa still be good enough for Neighbourhood Services?
      </p>
      <h4>
       Recycle
      </h4>
      <p>
       Finally, when all else fails, try to recycle. First, try to put it back where it came
from. Run your mower over your lawn twice to cut clippings fine enough they can be left
there, to act as natural fertiliser. As long as you don't use excessive artificial
fertiliser or pesticides to kill natural soil bacteria, clippings will decompose into
fertiliser long before next mowing day. Unless you have a very large tree, chopped
deciduous leaves will too. I chop mine with a mower, then spread them on my
       <a>
        garden
       </a>
       .
       <a name="compost">
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All non-meat food waste, and paper that isn't acceptable in your black box, will decompose in a compost pile. In fact, the
       <a>
        Composting Council of Canada
       </a>
       estimates that half of all solid waste in Canada
could be composted! An effective compost pile is open to the rain - water is absolutely necessary for natural decomposition.
Natural decomposition doesn't smell or attract pests as long as no meat is present and there is adequate air circulation.
Put it at the back of the back yard, surrounded by berry bushes that grab the nutrients as they enter the soil during rains
as my mother did and her's before her. Of course nothing decomposes in northern winters, but I've always found two
cubic meters adequate for year-round use. If you use clumping kitty litter, however, keep it away from a compost pile - it
forms a gooey chemical blob that doesn't decompose for years. If you live in an apartment, or dispose of a lot of meat
waste, campaign for a municipal green box program that composts such material at central sites as Ottawa now has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Support local blue box (glass, metal and plastics recycling) and black box (paper)
programs. Make recycling as easy as you can, with convenient containers in your kitchen and
next to your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some cities, such as Ottawa, sponsor a "Take It Back" program to identify
retailers of computers, TV's and appliances who look after proper disposal
of your old unit when you buy a new one. High tech electronics in particular contain
sufficient valuable metals to be worth specialized recycling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You too can greatly reduce the material your household sends to landfills.
For our environment and for our political peace of mind, it's worth it.
