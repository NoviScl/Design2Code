<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="War Tax Resister Juanita Nelson">In an excerpt from Juanita Nelson’s account of her arrest, I find sentiments about personal responsibility that are remarkably similar to those I expressed at the start of my experiment.</a></dd>

<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Pitstop Ploughshares Acquitted After Disabling U.S. Navy Plane">The “Pitstop Ploughshares”—a group of five peace activists from the Catholic Worker movement who broke into Shannon airport in Ireland and disabled a U.S. Navy supply plane with hammers and a pickaxe the month before the invasion of Iraq began—have been found not guilty by a Dublin jury. Also: an on-line recording of a talk by Juanita Nelson leads me to wonder about the return-on-investment of shock-and-awe.</a></dd>

<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Co-ops and Communes for, by, and of Tax Resisters">Tax resisters sometimes form cooperative housing or business relationships that help facilitate their resistance.

<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Employers Can Refuse to Withhold Taxes from Paychecks">Income tax withholding or “pay as you earn” makes it difficult for people to resist paying income tax. Resisters need their employers to be willing to go out on a limb and resist alongside them. Here are some examples of employers who have done just that.</a></dd>
<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Employers Can Refuse to Cooperate with Salary Levies">In addition to refusing to withhold taxes from the salaries of tax resisting employees, employers can also express their solidarity for such resisters by refusing to comply with salary levies.

<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Topple the Pillars of Taxpayer Compliance">If more people evade more taxes, even if they do so for non-idealistic reasons, this both takes resources away from the government and increases the number of targets the tax enforcers have to pursue, thereby taking some pressure off of the resisters. Here’s how to make that happen.</a></dd>
<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Accompany Tax Resistance Campaigns with Petitions to Government">Some tax resistance campaigns have accompanied their resistance with petitions to the government asking it to change its policies or to rescind the tax. Here are some examples.</a></dd>
<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="One Way to Resist a Tax: Convince the Government to Repeal It">One way a tax resistance campaign can claim victory is by convincing the government to either formally rescind the tax, or to recognize the legal validity of tax resistance.

<dd class="full robots-nocontent secondary" style="display:none"><a  title="Tax Resistance in “The Mennonite”, 1943">During World War Ⅱ the U.S. and Canadian governments sold “war bonds” and “victory loan bonds” to the public, and there was high pressure to buy.
