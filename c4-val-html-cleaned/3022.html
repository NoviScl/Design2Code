        <p><b><font size="+2">The Village of Rushville and Its Records</font></b> 
        <br>
        </p><hr width="100%">

        <p>Rushville was incorporated in 1876 and lies in both Ontario and Yates 
        Counties, in the towns of Gorham and Potter respectively.&nbsp; 
        </p><p>The first settlement within what are now the village limits was made 
          in 1791 by Elias Gilbert, who purchased the extreme northwest lot in 
          the town of Potter and built a house there of poplar poles, on a site 
          already cleared by the Indians for the growing of corn, with a few of 
          their apple trees still remaining. His house was near an old Indian 
          trail which became the main road between the settlement and Canandaigua, 
          then and now the seat of Ontario County which at that&nbsp; time included 
          most of western New York.&nbsp; 
        </p><p>Many of the settlement's first settlers were from Massachusetts and 
        it was known initially as Federal Hollow from the Federalist politics of 
        the inhabitants. After the turn of the century, however, the 
        Jeffersonian party grew more popular, and the place was renamed after 
        Dr. Benjamin Rush of Revolutionary fame, said to be the first place in 
        America to be named for Jefferson's good friend.&nbsp; 
        </p><p>The first tavern in Rushville was opened by Beza Whitman, and in 1801 
        his son Marcus was born in a house belonging to the elder Whitman's 
        brother-in-law Henry Green. The boy, who grew up in Rushville, pioneered 
        the Oregon Trail in 1836; his wife Narcissa Prentiss and her sister were 
        the first white women to cross the Rockies. Not too far from Whitman's 
        tavern was a store opened in 1812 by Philander Woodworth. The store was 
        in a small house that still stands on Main Street; the county line 
        passes right through it.&nbsp; 
        </p><p>The village was incorporated in 1876. Its commercial section and the 
        majority of its population (about 400 persons) are located within Yates 
        County. The village hall is at 1 Main Street, on the east side nearly 
        opposite the intersection with Gilbert Street.&nbsp;
