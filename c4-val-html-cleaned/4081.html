	<h2>
	Richard A. Lapping</h2>
<p>
	Rich's diverse practice focuses chiefly on bankruptcy and insolvency issues, business issues and commercial litigation. He spent four years as a partner with Winston &amp; Strawn LLP and twenty-six years at Thelen LLP, where at different times he was the San Francisco Office Managing Partner, the Recruiting Partner and the Chair of the Bankruptcy Department.</p>
<p>
	Rich has extensive experience representing companies facing financial distress in and out of court.&nbsp; He represents Chapter 11 trustees, debtors, creditors, and parties to transactions with debtors before, during, and after bankruptcies and in litigation matters.&nbsp; In addition, he advises clients in commercial matters and out-of-court debt restructuring, partnership dissolution, securitization, trust formation, acquisitions, and divestitures in connection with financially distressed assets, and has advised corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships on creditors’ rights, governance, and control issues.</p>
<p>
	<strong>2015 Year in Review</strong></p>
<p>
	In 2015, Rich provided diverse restructuring and litigation advice and planning to a fitness company, a specialty medical practice, an international accounting firm, two owners of wineries, the co-owner of an international construction company, a co-owner of a local engineering firm, a multi-employer pension fund; a California charter school, a biotech company and a foreign airline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Rich aided the largest unsecured creditor, a multi-employer pension fund, in converting an unsecured contingent claim into a secured claim under a confirmed plan of reorganization in the Pacific Steel case.&nbsp; He represented the bankruptcy trustee in the Collazo chapter 7 case, which, after the contested sale of the debtor’s technology company and Atherton mansion, was successfully concluded by the settlement of a bankruptcy avoidance action against a major law firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Rich represented the chapter 11 trustee in the Tollenaar Holsteins case involving the sale of two herds of dairy cows in California and Oklahoma, and recovered all of the trustee’s statutory and professional fees from secured creditors in a contested surcharge motion.&nbsp; He represented a biotech company in state court litigation pursuing reformation of a commercial lease provision and settled on favorable terms after successfully defeating the landlord’s anti-SLAPP motion and unlawful detainer action.&nbsp; And he overcame unfavorable facts to recover a substantial disputed real estate commission on the $10 million plus sale of a ranch and operating quarry in central California through mediation.&nbsp;</p>
