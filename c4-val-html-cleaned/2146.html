    Lake Annette

  Saturday promised to be sunny, if somewhat windy, so I chose
         Lake Annette as a location that should provide some nice
         scenery, without presenting much of an avalanche hazard. I
         arrived at the parking area around 10:00, and there were a
         couple of other cars already there. The snow along the road
         to the trailhead was soft enough that I was glad I'd brought
         snowshoes along, but once on the trail the snow is well
         packed in most areas, and there were several other folks
         without snowshoes doing just fine. In places the trail has
         been packed down two feet wide, with 6 inch "curbs" on either
         side - there's no difficulties in following it to the lake.
         Nice views of Humpback on the way, and a very nice view of
         the north face of Abiel once at the lake - snow, ice and rime
         encrusted.
