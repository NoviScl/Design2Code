  <h2>
   <font color="#DF2C26">
    Marmosets and Clamp Campus Detectives
   </font>
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  I finally got a marmoset cel!  It's so cool!  I don't have it
up in my gallery yet, but you can
  <a>
   see 
it
  </a>
  as my "favorite cel" entry in the
  <a>
   JACML
  </a>
  member's
showcase.  (If you're a member of JACML and haven't submitted a 
favorite cel, you should!  And if you're not a member, it's a
good list to join for cel announcements.)
  <p>
  </p>
  If anyone's been wondering, the little monkeys wandering around my 
gallery are from episode 22 of Clamp Campus Detectives.
I've always been fond of marmosets, and the ones in this show are
just too cute.  There are a bunch of screencaptures from the
episode on my
  <a>
   Pygmy Marmoset Page.
  </a>
  (Warning, that
page has spoilers for episode 22.)  I now have one
marmoset cel, but as you might guess from the marmoset
density on my page, I'm still enthusiastically looking for
more.  They must be out there somewhere!  Either cels
with both marmosets and humans, or just marmosets alone
would be great.
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm also interested in other nice Clamp Campus Detectives cels.  I'm
particularly looking for cels of
  <a>
   Suoh
  </a>
  in his red-and-white
  <a>
   baseball 
uniform,
  </a>
  or his
  <a>
   Japanese 
archery uniform.
  </a>
  A cel of either the regular or penguin-shaped
student council blimp would also be quite cool.
  <p>
  </p>
  In general, I'm 
likely to be interested in any "special" CCD cels like OP/ED,
oversized, backgrounded, omake, hanken mono (hey, I can dream, 
can't I?), etc.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>
   <font color="#DF2C26">
    Rurouni Kenshin
   </font>
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm looking in particular to get one really nice cel of
  <a>
   Kenshin,
  </a>
  either happy or
looking scary and battousai-ish.
  <p>
  </p>
  I also really want a cel of Kenshin and Kaoru together.
  <p>
  </p>
  While I'm dreaming, I'd like
a nice cel of Hiko Seijuro,
and a pony.  (Those are separate wishes,
though if there were a cel of Hiko with a pony, I'm sure I'd want it.)
  :-)
  <p>
  </p>
  Perhaps more realistically, I'm looking for nice cels of
Sano, especially with Megumi or Sayo, 
and Kaoru, especially in her fighting outfit.  I'd also like cels
of other characters who I don't have yet, and I could stand to have
a nicer cel of Misao.
  <p>
  </p>
  The above were all TV wishes, but I'm also really looking
for cels from the OAVs.  In particular, I'd love to find
cels of Tomoe, Saitoh, and Hiko Seijuro, but I'm also very
interested in good Kenshin cels.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>
   <font color="#DF2C26">
    Shoujo Kakumei Utena
   </font>
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  From the TV series, I'm particularly looking for cels of
Arisugawa Jury.  She is my favorite Utena character, and one 
of my all-time favorite anime characters.  If only cels
of her were a bit easier to find!
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm also looking for nice cels of Utena; in particular
I'd like a really nice close-up face-forward shot of
her in any outfit.  I'm also looking for cels of her
duelling in which she doesn't look too distorted by
action, and group cels of her with other characters.
  <p>
  </p>
  Other characters I'm looking for (should any happen to
wander into my price range) include Akio, Dios,
and Saionji.  I'd love to have more Wakaba, as
well as any nice backgrounded cels.
  <p>
  </p>
  From the movie, I'm once again looking desperately for
Jury, but what I particularly want is a nice face-forward
shot, preferably fairly close-up (not easy to find given
the style of the movie).  I'm also looking for a nice
cel of Utena with her hair down, a nice Anthy, and any
Touga, Miki, Shadow-play Girls, or Saionji.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>
   <font color="#DF2C26">
    Rose of Versailles
   </font>
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  Sigh...I've gone and fallen in love with another show
whose cels are often rare and expensive.  How _do_ I
do it?  :-)  I've made a little
  <a>
   screencap gallery
  </a>
  of
the characters to help with telling who's who.  In
general I realize that Rose of Versailles cels are
very prone to line-fading due to their age and the
preponderance of yellow and light brown paint colors.
I can live with moderate fading, but not the "invisible
eyes" sort.
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm pretty much looking for any of the characters
in that gallery, but in particular, I'm looking for
good cels of Oscar, especially when she is older,
as in the screencap.  Any outfit or uniform is good,
and group cels of her with Antoinette, Andr&eacute;, or
Fersen would be great, as would cels of her on a
horse, even if they are somewhat distant.
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm also really looking for nice cels of Andr&eacute;,
both long-haired and short-haired versions, any
outfit.
  <p>
  </p>
  A nice Fersen cel would be great, even better if
he is with Oscar or Antoinette.  I'm also looking
for Antoinette by herself, but particularly for
something nicely close-up, preferably with one of
her more elaborate hairstyles.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>
   <font color="#DF2C26">
    Legend of the Galactic Heroes
   </font>
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  Another new love, and fortunately a somewhat easier
and less expensive one to fulfill, though naturally
I'm fond of the most coveted characters.  :-)  My
search is also made more difficult by the fact that as
far as I can tell all the cels from the original
LoGH OAV series were used as flooring at the studio
for several years before being hurled for distance
into crowds of ravening fans looking for something
to hang in their gym lockers.  Possibly this is a slight 
exaggeration, but I'm not convinced.
  <p>
  </p>
  Anyway, I am looking first and foremost for cels of
Siegfried Kircheis (curly red hair, Galactic Empire).
I'd prefer cels from the original OAV series rather
than the side stories, but either would be good.  I'm
especially looking for cels of him with Reinhard
von Lohengramm (blonde hair of varying length, Galactic Empire),
as well of cels of either/both of them when they were 
children/young men.
I'll
try to get some images up for this section soon, but
until then
  <a>
   Logh.net
  </a>
  has a great
  <a>
   character
guide
  </a>
  with thumbnails.
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm also looking for nice (and as undamaged as possible)
cels of Yang Wen-Li (dark blue hair, Free Planets Alliance).
  <p>
  </p>
  In addition, I'd love to find good cels of Oskar von Reuentahl
(dark brown hair, mismatched eyes) and Wolfgang Mittermeyer
(orange-blonde hair, blue eyes).  Even better if they're together.
(I often think LoGH is the pefect ad for yaoi doujinshi. ;-)  )
  <p>
  </p>
  Among the women, I'd like to find cels of Jessica Edwards
(shoulder-length curly blonde hair), Reinhard's sister
Annerose (long straight blonde hair), and Frederica Greenhill
(short blonde hair, Free Planets Alliance).
  <p>
  </p>
  Besides the above, I'm sort of looking for cels of, well,
everyone, :-)  with a preference for cels from the original
OAV series.
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2>
   <font color="#DF2C26">
    Cowboy Bebop
   </font>
  </h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  I'm looking for a nice Spike cel, but I'm
  <i>
   really, really
  </i>
  looking for a cel of Ein, the dog.  Or even a
  <i>
   dog
  </i>
  of
Ein, the dog.  Anyone have a superintelligent Pembroke Welsh
Corgi for sale?  ;-)
  <p>
  </p>
  A cel from one of the sepia-tone flashback sequences or the
  <a>
   "falling
out the window"
  </a>
  scene from episode 5 would be great, too.
  <p>
  </p>
