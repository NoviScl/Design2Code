History of Malden
</center>      <p>Malden was settled by <a title="Puritans" >Puritans</a>
      in <a title="1640" >1640</a> on
      land purchased in <a title="1629" >1629</a>
      from the Pawtucket Indians. Initially a part of <a title="Charlestown, Massachusetts" >Charlestown</a>,
      it was incorporated as a separate town in <a title="1649" >1649</a>.
      The name Malden was selected by <a class="new" title="Joseph Hills" >Joseph
      Hills</a> and was named after <a title="Maldon, Essex" >Maldon,
      England</a> (from Hills family tree information). Malden, which originally
      included what are now the adjacent cities of <a title="Melrose, Massachusetts" >Melrose</a>
      (until <a title="1850" >1850</a>)
      and <a title="Everett, Massachusetts" >Everett</a>
      (until <a title="1870" >1870</a>),
      was incorporated as a city in <a title="1882" >1882</a>.</p>
      <p>The first code of enacted laws printed in <a title="New England" >New
      England</a> was compiled here by Joseph Hills in <a title="1648" >1648</a>.
      Malden also has the reputation of being the first town to petition the
      colonial government to withdraw from the <a title="British Empire" >British
