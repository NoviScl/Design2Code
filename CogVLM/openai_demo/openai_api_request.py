"""
This script is designed to mimic the OpenAI API interface with CogVLM & CogAgent Chat
It demonstrates how to integrate image and text-based input to generate a response.
Currently, the model can only handle a single image.
Therefore, do not use this script to process multiple images in one conversation. (includes images from history)
And it only works on the chat model, not the base model.
