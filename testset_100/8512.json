If I'm doing a high altitude bomb run and use the camera to lock on to a target i'll need to have that radius set to the altitude I'm bombing from?", "17": "I was just wondering because if I set my plane radius to let's say 3000m and my jet goes mach 1 lol I'll see a fps drop like crazy because my system is trying to load all the objects popping up at one time.", "18": "Thanks for any info.", "19": "A", "20": "AngusDLX", "21": "4 Sep 2018", "22": "The camera is not taken into account in the spawn radius but the aircraft.", "23": "I had terrible experiences playing with attack jeets on ALiVE precisely because of the spawn radius in airplanes. If you increase too much, spawn / despawn will actually cause fps dropl (not because of ALiVE but because of the amount of objects appearing and disappearing, especially in areas with many enemies).", "24": "My only way was to set the spawn radius at 200 (so the bots that are at an airport for example are visible) and use a drone to move to the attack area to spawn the targets. The problem is that sometimes the AR-2 Darter gets drunk (ArmaBUG) and takes too long to get to the destination or worse, is killed before arriving.", "25": "SpyderBlack gave some tips on how to replace this drone with an object that will call ALiVE_spawnSources and generate the spawn in a specific location but I could not get it to work.", "26": "One possibility could also be: Once the ALiVE generates an air-related task like CAS, SEAD for example, it creates an object using spawnSources and deletes it as soon as the object is destroyed. I do not know if it would be possible but it is a suggestion to the devs.", "27": "So players on planes can view and attack their targets at a safe distance without knocking down their own fps or everyone present. As I said, more than 1 plane on the server can create many problems when the spawn radius is high.", "28": "Fletcher", "29": "4 Sep 2018", "30": "Oh ok thanks man!", "31": "Friznit", "32": "5 Sep 2018", "33": "Administrator", "34": "That's not a bad idea actually. We could potentially add a capability for players to place a \"Target\" marker over an intended objective which spawns an invisible object that calls ALiVE_spawnSources.", "35": "Log In", "36": "or", "37": "Sign Up", "38": "to reply!", "39": "Go to top", "40": "Powered by esoTalk", "41": "Loading...", "42": "Loading..."}
