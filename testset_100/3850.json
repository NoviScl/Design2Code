These are the providers where you just can register and get an email address for \u2018free\u2019.", "21": "Paid email", "22": "These are the providers where you pay some amount of money to host your email, usually you get this with your hosting provider or you can go with another party to host it like Office 365, Gmail for Business.", "23": "Branding", "24": "The most important part of your company is how your customers can reach you, this can be done by visiting your website, send an email or by phone. My feeling with a company that uses a free email address gives themselves not enough credit for how they brand themselves to the outside world.", "25": "Privacy", "26": "When you use a free email provider, privacy is usually the first one that will be sacrificed.

When you choose for a paid email provider the cost can be from a few Euro\u2019s/Dollars per month to around 10 Euro\u2019s/Dollars depending on the provider or options of the email provider.", "29": "Accessibility", "30": "Nowadays we have at least 2 devices if not more where we check our email on.

Well the email part is not the problem here, but when you run a business you also make appointments and invite other people for those appointments.", "33": "Conclusion", "34": "Selecting your email provider is not as easy as it might see.
