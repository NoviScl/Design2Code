In the newly independent nation of Slovakia, they call it an engineering triumph.", "15": "(Sound of water over dam)", "16": "DVORSON: This is not the River Danube of lilting waltzes and romantic landscapes of Central Europe. This is a fifteen-mile-long greenish-brown canal whose water has been squeezed off from its original riverbed a few miles away.", "17": "LISKA: Do you think that production of electricity is harmful for anybody? I can assure of one thing: that this project was never meant to do any harm to the Hungarian people living in this country.", "18": "DVORSON: The director of a Hungarian environmental group, economist Gyorgy Dropa of the Danube Circle, disagrees.", "19": "DROPA: This is simply not true, because if you dam the river you have to face the question of the poisoning of the drinking water, and nothing can be done against that.", "20": "DVORSON: The Danube Circle, along with other environmental groups like the Worldwide Fund for Nature, say the Gabcikovo Dam has disrupted the river's natural flushing processes that once kept the drinking water for five million people free of pollution. They say the project will demolish the habitat for five thousand species of plant and animal life, including deer, otter, beaver and birds.", "21": "BRUZAK: The unilateral cancellation of an international treaty is an entirely political step. There is a dam already built, we are ready to discuss all questions, all proposals, but first of all, let us reaccept the original treaty from 1977, and discuss the project as a whole.", "22": "DVORSON: Crossing the border by train from Slovakia to Hungary is fairly routine. At the customs post, a young man wheeling a pushcart sells burnt coffee and cola through the windows of the train.", "23": "TATAR: We know that we have to live together with Slovakia. If we want to live in peace, and we want to develop as a nation, then we have to settle the whole dispute by peaceful means.", "24": "DVORSON: But the decision of the International Court in the Hague could take two to three years. In the meantime, there's no resolution on how the Danube's water should be managed.", "25": "SIMECKA: It's black and white. As in Hungary it started to be in fact a symbol of ecological disaster and symbol of political success to stop Gabcikovo from the Hungarian side, from the Slovak side on the contrary it is to finish it and fulfill our job as a big Slovak success.", "26": "DVORSON: On its nearly twelve-hundred mile journey through nine nations from the Black Forest to the Black Sea, the Danube flows past Budapest and Bratislava, the Slovak capital. It's as though the Danube itself has become a metaphor for the ideological differences between Hungary and Slovakia.", "27": "For Living on Earth, this is Alexa Dvorson at the Gabcikovo Dam on the River Danube.", "28": "Please enable JavaScript to view", "29": "comments.", "30": "Living on Earth wants to hear from you!", "31": "Living on Earth", "32": "62 Calef Highway, Suite 212", "33": "Lee, NH 03861", "34": "Telephone: [PHONE REDACTED]", "35": "--> --> E-mail: [EMAIL REDACTED]", "36": "Newsletter", "37": "[Click here]", "38": "Donate to Living on Earth!", "39": "Living on Earth is an independent media program and relies entirely on contributions from listeners and institutions supporting public service.
