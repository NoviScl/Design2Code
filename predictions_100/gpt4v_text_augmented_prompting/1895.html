<div class="sub-header">Carrot clan</div>
<p>As we walked, Air and Wander told us fantastic tales of the great dwarven carrot clan. They dig deep for gems and other stuff.</p>
<p>All Grins is apparently not from carrots. He from Hardly Grins.</p>
<p>For Napkin is getting a little frisky with wolf Low Show. I think For Napkin is a little bored with us.</p>
<p>We not have any more drink. And while a wolf is nice and all, not so much a dragon, me thinks.</p>
<p>We had to go single file along a path. Then Barrel and Air stopped.</p>
<p>Well, guard refused to let Pitter go. Me stay with Pitter to the bitter end.</p>
<p>I asked if he wanted to wrestle. He got this glint in his eye.</p>
<p>I see our people approach with a rather tallish dwarf. He looks important.</p>
