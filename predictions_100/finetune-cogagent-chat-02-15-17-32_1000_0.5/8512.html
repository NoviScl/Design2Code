            <div class="post-body">On the Virtual AI System module radius setting, this needs to be set in order to actually see anything on the ground right? If I'm doing a high altitude bomb run and use the camera to lock on to a target I'll need to have that radius set to the altitude I'm bombing from?</div>
            <div class="post-footer">I was just wondering because if I set my plane radius to let's say 3000m and my jet goes mach 1 I'll see a fps drop like crazy because my system is trying to load all the objects popping up at one time. Thanks for any info.</div>

                <div class="post-tags">I had terrible experiences playing with attack jets on ALIVE precisely because of the spawn radius in airplanes. If you increase too much, spawn / despawn will actually cause fps drop (not because of ALIVE but because of the amount of objects appearing and disappearing, especially in areas with many enemies).</div>
            </div>
            <div class="post-body">My only way was to set the spawn radius at 200 (so the bots that are at an airport for example are visible) and use a drone to move to the attack area to spawn the targets. The problem is that sometimes the AR-2 Darter gets drunk (ArmabU) and takes too long to get to the destination or worse, is killed before arriving.</div>
            <div class="post-footer">SpydersBlack gave some tips on how to replace this drone with an object that will call ALIVE_spawnSources and generate the spawn in a specific location but I could not get it to work. One possibility could also be: Once the ALIVE generates an air-related task like CAS, SEAD for example, it creates an object using spawnSources and deletes it as soon as the object is destroyed. I do not know if it would be possible but it is a suggestion to the devs. So players on planes can view and attack their targets at a safe distance without knocking down their own fps or everyone present. As I said, more than 1 plane on the server can create many problems when the spawn radius is high.</div>

            <div class="post-body">That's not a bad idea actually. We could potentially add a capability for players to place a "Target" marker over an intended objective which spawns an invisible object that calls ALIVE_spawnSources.</div>
