            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>Generally, a Captain's Log video is one in which Chris addresses his fanbase, a sort of video blog where he asks his True and Loyal fanbase to be his friend.</p>
            <p>This is in contrast to other styles of Chris videos, such as those where he addresses a specific individual (other expecting people to know he's posted a video about them, such as Michael Snyder of The Game Place) or his music videos.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, a video is dead serious, and therefore not worthy of a Captain's Log introduction.</p>

            <h3>Chris and Star Trek</h3>
            <p>Interestingly enough, Chris is not a Trekkie/Trekker and had never seen any Star Trek media as of 2009. [1][2], his usage of the phrase most likely comes from other shows that reference it, such as Family Guy and Futurama. He may have encountered the phrase from the Star Trek game he purchased as a result of the Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes competition, but knowing his gaming habits, he probably never played it.</p>
