How the race is run:

Each team (or "crew") will receive a clue packet, which when solved, will lead them to the location where they will obtain the next clue packet, and so on until the team reaches the finish line. Figuring out the answer to the clues might involve solving a puzzle or knowing trivia from the worlds of science fiction.

Prizes:

First place: $100.

Second place: $30.

What does a crew need?

Each crew needs a reliable vehicle for the race, with at least one licensed driver (pilot). The vehicle must have a seat belt for each crewmate. Each crew also needs at least one mobile phone to contact the team if necessary. There will be a mandatory break for lunch so bring some cash for food or other miscellaneous items.

It might be handy to bring water, pens, snacks, maps, spare change for parking meters, moscot, camera, comic walking or running footwear, alien autopsy tools, or a spare composition collar or warp injector.

How challenging will it be?

Some of the puzzles might range in difficulty, but once solved, they should give you a clue of where to go next. Because there are so many fields and franchises in science fiction, the trivia will most likely be at a basic level. There won't be any overly physically demanding activities like climbing, swimming or eating gross things. If you need help, your crew can always welcome to ask a stanger, talk to another team or phone a friend.

If your crew gets stumped, you can call in to the race organizers for help, but it might cost you a time penalty. More detailed questions cost a 15 minute penalty.
