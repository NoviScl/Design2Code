The screenshot shows the 'Captain's Log' page from the Cryptic Studios MMO game, Star Trek Online. The page is divided into several sections. At the top, there's a navigation bar with options such as 'Main Page', 'Community portal', 'Recent changes', and 'What links here'. Below the navigation bar, there's a blue box with the title 'Captain's Log'. To the right of the title, there are two smaller blue boxes. The main content area begins with a section titled 'Real life: the final frontier', discussing the influence of the Jolow Chiris-Chan character on the game's story. There are also sections for 'Characteristics', 'Chris and Star Trek', and 'Captain's Blog', each with their own subsections and links. At the bottom, there's a 'Categories' section with links to various game-related pages. The page footer contains links to the game's privacy policy, about Cryptic Studios, and other legal information.
