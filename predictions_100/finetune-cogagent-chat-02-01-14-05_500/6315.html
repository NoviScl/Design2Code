<html><body><p>The screenshot shows a webpage from ATTN:Magazine with a dark theme. The top of the page has a navigation bar with options for 'Curious sound.', 'HOME', 'RECORD', 'CRUCIAL LISTENING', and 'MASTERING'. Below the navigation bar, there's a 'BA DA BING' heading followed by a large, bold title 'Review: Circuit Des Yeux - Overdue'. A brief description talks about Lithonia's swoop romantically into their own reflection and mentions the album 'overdue' playing between the majestic melodic arcs. The review is attributed to Jack Chuter, dated NOV 14, 2013. Two song reviews are listed below: 'Richard Youngs - Summer Through My Mind' and 'Rangda + Dead C - Split', both with brief descriptions and dates. At the bottom, there's a section to 'Subscribe to ATTN:Magazine' with a 'Subscribe now' button and a 'Sign up' link.
