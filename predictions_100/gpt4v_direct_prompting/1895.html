    <h2>Carrot clan</h2>
    <p>As we walked, Air and Wander told us fantastic tales of the great dwarven carrot clan. They dig deep for gems and other stuff.<br>
    All Grins is apparently not from carrots. He from Hardly Grins.<br>
    For Napkin is getting a little frisky with wolf Low Show. I think For Napkin is a little bored with us.<br>
    We not have any more drink. And while a wolf is nice and all, not so much a dragon, me thinks.<br>
    We had to go single file along a path. Then Barrel and Air stopped.<br>
    Well, guard refused to let Pitter go. Me stay with Pitter to the bitter end.<br>
    I asked if he wanted to wrestle. He got this glint in his eye.<br>
    I see our people approach with a rather tallish dwarf. He looks important.<br>
