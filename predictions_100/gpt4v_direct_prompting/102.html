      <p>Real life: the final frontier. These are the fails of the lolcow Chris-Chan. His continuing Love Quest: to explore strange new Attraction Locations, to seek out new gal-pals, and new sweethearts; to boldly go where no high-functioning autistic virgin has gone before.</p>

      <p>"Captain's Log" was, for a while Chris's usual opening to a video blog, first appearing in his 24 September 2008 video. It comes from popular sci-fi franchise Star Trek. Star Trek Captain's Log entries are noticeably void of tard rage.</p>

      <p class="section-title">Characteristics</p>
      <p>Generally, a Captain's Log video is one in which Chris addresses his fanbase, a sort of video blog where he asks his True and Loyal fanbase to be his personal army to express his hatred about some troll.</p>
