                    <p>Good evening gentlemen/ladies.</p>
                    <p>On the Virtual Al System module radius setting, this needs to be set in order to actually see anything on the ground right? If I'm doing a high altitude bomb run and use the camera to lock on to a target I'll need to have that radius set to the altitude I'm bombing from?</p>
                    <p>I was just wondering because if I set my plane radius to let's say 3000m and my jet goes mach 1 lol I'll see a fps drop like crazy because my system is trying to load all the objects popping up at one time.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for any info.</p>

            <p>The camera is not taken into account in the spawn radius but the aircraft.</p>
            <p>I had terrible experiences playing with attack jets on ALIVE precisely because of the spawn radius in airplanes. If you increase too much, spawn / despawn will actually cause pps drop (not because of ALIVE but because of the amount of objects appearing and disappearing, especially in areas with many enemies).</p>
            <p>My only way was to set the spawn radius at 200 (so the bots that are at an airport for example are visible) and use a drone to move to the attack area to spawn the targets. The problem is that sometimes the AR-2 Darter gets drunk (ArmabU) and takes too long to get to the destination or worse, is killed before arriving.</p>
            <p>SpydersBlack gave some tips on how to replace this drone with an object that will call ALIVE_spawnSources and generate the spawn in a specific location but I could not get it to work.</p>
            <p>One possibility could also be: Once the ALIVE generates an air-related task like CAS, SEAD for example, it creates an object using spawnSources and deletes it as soon as the object is destroyed. I do not know if it would be possible but it is a suggestion to the devs.</p>
            <p>So players on planes can view and attack their targets at a safe distance without knocking down their own fps or everyone present. As I said, more than 1 plane on the server can create many problems when the spawn radius is high.</p>

            <p>That's not a bad idea actually. We could potentially add a capability for players to place a "Target" marker over an intended objective which spawns an invisible object that calls ALIVE_spawnSources.</p>
