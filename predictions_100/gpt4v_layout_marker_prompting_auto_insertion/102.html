        <p>“ Real life: the final frontier. These are the fails of the lolcow Chris-Chan. His continuing Love Quest: to explore strange new Attraction Locations, to seek out new gal-pals, and new sweethearts; to boldly go where no high-functioning autistic virgin has gone before. ”</p>

      <p>Ladies, set Tasers to stun.</p>
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <p>Generally, a Captain's Log video is one in which Chris addresses his fanbase, a sort of video blog where he asks his True and Loyal fanbase to be his personal army or to express his hatred about some troll .</p>
      <h3>Chris and Star Trek</h3>
      <p>Interestingly enough, Chris is not a Trekker/Trekkie and had never seen any Star Trek media as of 2009 .</p>
      <h3>Captain's Blog</h3>
      <p>November 2009 , Chris began maintaining an irregular text blog on the CWCipedia , featuring updates on the progress of his comic and his quest to turn Sonichu into the heart of a multimedia empire.</p>
      <h3>Goddess Log</h3>
      <p>letter from jail dated 8 November 2021 , Chris reveals that he is keeping a journal in jail called his "Goddess Log". He intends to release it to the public when he is released.</p>
