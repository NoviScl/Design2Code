      “Real life: the final frontier.
      These are the fails of the lolcow Chris-Chan. His continuing Love Quest: to explore strange new Attraction Locations, to seek out new gal-pals, and new sweethearts; to boldly go where no high-functioning autistic virgin has gone before.”

    <p>Ladies, set Tasers to stun.</p>

    <p>"Captain's Log" was, for a while, Chris's usual opening to a video blog, first appearing in his <a href="#">24 September 2008 video</a>. It comes from popular sci-fi franchise <a href="#">Star Trek</a>.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, Chris gave an incorrect date (though the date is technically always incorrect since he says "Stardate" and gives a Gregorian Calendar date), or failed to provide a date at all. An example of Chris giving an incorrect date would be many of the entries made in July 2009. The CWCki has organized the Captain's Log entries by the date they were uploaded.</p>
    <p>In many Captain's Logs from 2017, Chris instead gives the day's date in MM/DD/YYYY format as a string of eight digits, possibly in an effort to sound more technical or scientific. For example, CLog 06142017 has Chris pronouncing "Stardate zero-six-four-two-zero-one-seven". Surprisingly, Chris rarely stumbles over such long strings of numbers, though he does say them in a stilted manner and sometimes has trouble remembering them.</p>
    <p>More recently, he has taken to opening his videos with "Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again," even though most of the videos with this introduction were not recorded live.</p>
    <p>"Captain's Log" appeared most recently in Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW. Several weeks after the video's release, Chris would find himself arrested for banging his own mom.</p>
