      Good evening gents/ladies. On the Virtual AI System module radius setting, this needs to be set in order to actually see anything on the ground right? If I'm doing a high altitude bomb run and use the camera to lock on to a target i'll need to have that radius set to the altitude I'm bombing from? I was just wondering because if I set my plane radius to let's say 3000m and my jet goes mach 1 lol I'll see a fps drop like crazy because my system is trying to load all the objects popping up at one time. Thanks for any info.

      The camera is not taken into account in the spawn radius but the aircraft. I had terrible experiences playing with attack jeets on ALiVE precisely because of the spawn radius in airplanes. If you increase too much, spawn / despawn will actually cause fps drop! My only way was to set the spawn radius at 200 (so the bots that are at an airport for example are visible) and use a drone to move to the attack area to spawn the targets. The problem is that sometimes the AR-2 Darter gets drunk (ArmaBUG) and takes too long to get to the destination or worse, is killed before arriving. SpyderBlack gave some tips on how to replace this drone with an object that will call ALiVE_spawnSources and generate the spawn in a specific location but I could not get it to work. One possibility could also be: Once the ALiVE generates an air-related task like CAS, SEAD for example, it creates an object using spawnSources and deletes it as soon as the object is destroyed. I do not know if it would be possible but it is a suggestion to the devs. So players on planes can view and attack their targets at a safe distance without knocking down their own fps or everyone present. As I said, more than 1 plane on the server can create many problems when the spawn radius is high.

      That's not a bad idea actually. We could potentially add a capability for players to place a "Target" marker over an intended objective which spawns an invisible object that calls ALiVE_spawnSources.
