            <h1>Captain's Log</h1>
            <p>Real life: the final frontier.</p>
            <p>These are the fairies of the Jolcow Chris-Chan. His continuing Love Quest to explore strange new Attraction Locations, to seek out new gal-pals, and to bring happiness to all.</p>
            <p>Virgin has gone before...</p>

            <p>...and now she is back!</p>
            <p>In his later videos, Chris began to stop including it, and he had completely ceased to use it by 2011.</p>
            <p>However, the opening made a glorious return on 19 July 2016 with Update 20160718, only to be followed by another update in September 2016.</p>
            <p>Chris has begun consistently referring to his YouTube livestreams as "Chris's Galaxy", though he typically abbreviates it as "CG" or "cLG". In the video titles, often he refers to himself and Sonichu Medallion and introduces the video as a Captain's Log. It seems that Chris is capitalizing on nostalgia for his older days to bait his own fans into giving him money.</p>
            <p>"Captain's Log" appeared most recently in Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW. Several weeks after the video's release, Chris would find himself...</p>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Generally, a Captain's Log video is one in which Chris addresses his fanbase, a sort of video blog where he asks his True and Loyal fanbase to be his friend.</p>
            <p>This is in contrast to other styles of Chris videos, such as those where he addresses a specific individual (often expecting people to know he's posted a video about them, such as Michael Snyder of The Game Place) or his music videos.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, a video is dead serious, and therefore not worthy of a Captain's Log introduction.</p>
            <h2>Chris and Star Trek</h2>
            <p>Interestingly enough, Chris is not a Trekkie and had never seen any Star Trek media as of 2009. [1] His usage of the phrase most likely comes from other shows that reference it, such as Family Guy and Futurama. He may have encountered the phrase from the Star Trek movie he purchased as a result of the Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes competition, but knowing his gaming habits, he probably never played it.</p>
            <p>Star Trek franchise.</p>
