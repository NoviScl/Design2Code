    <p>"Captain's Log" was, for a while, Chris's usual opening to a video blog, first appearing in his <a href="#">24 September 2008 video</a>. It comes from popular sci-fi franchise <a href="#">Star Trek</a>.</p>
    <p>Star Trek Captain's Log entries are noticeably void of tard rage. Sometimes, Chris gave an incorrect date (though the date is technically always incorrect since he says "Stardate" and gives a Gregorian Calendar date), or failed to provide a date at all. An example of Chris giving an incorrect date would be many of the entries made in July 2009. The CWCki has organized the Captain's Log entries by the date they were uploaded.</p>
    <p>In many Captain's Logs from 2017, Chris instead gives the day's date in MM/DD/YYYY format as a string of eight digits, possibly in an effort to sound more technical or scientific. For example, CLog 06142017 has Chris pronouncing "Stardate zero-six-one-four-two-zero-one-seven". Surprisingly, Chris rarely stumbles over such long strings of numbers, though he does say them in a stilted manner and sometimes has trouble remembering them.</p>
    <p>In his later videos, Chris began to stop including it, and he had completely ceased to use it by 2011. However, the opening made a glorious return on 18 July 2016 with Update 20160718, only to be quickly and unceremoniously abandoned for nearly a year. Starting in April 2017 with Live Game Stream - C-Log 04142017, Chris has begun consistently referring to his YouTube livestreams as Captain's Logs again, though he typically abbreviates it as "C-Log" or "CLog" in the video titles. Of special note is Live Game Stream - C-Log 04192017 - The Shirt, wherein Chris wears his classic shirt and Sonichu Medallion and introduces the video as a Captain's Log. It seems that Chris is capitalizing on nostalgia for his older days to bait his own trolls into giving him money.</p>
    <p>More recently, he has taken to opening his videos with "Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again," even though most of the videos with this introduction were not recorded live.</p>
    <p>"Captain's Log" appeared most recently in Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW. Several weeks after the video's release, Chris would find himself arrested for banging his own mom.</p>
