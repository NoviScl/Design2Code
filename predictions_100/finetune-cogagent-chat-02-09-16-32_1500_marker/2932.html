    How theraceis run:
   </p>
<p>
    Each team (or "crew") will receive a clue packet, which when solved, will lead them to the location where they will obtain the next clue packet, and so on until the team reaches the finish line. Figuring out the answer to the clues might involve solving a puzzle or knowing trivia from the worlds of science fiction.
   </p>
<p>
    Prizes:
   </p>
<p>
    First place: $100.
   </p>
<p>
    Second place: $30.
   </p>
<p>
    What does a crew need?
   </p>
<p>
    Each crew needs a reliable vehicle for therace, with at least one licensed driver (pilot). The vehicle must have a seat belt for each crewmate. Each crew also needs at least one mobile phone to contact the team if necessary. There will be a mandatory break for lunch so bring some cash for food or other miscellaneous items.
   </p>
<p>
    It might be handy to bring water, pens, snacks, maps, spare change for parking meters, mascot, camera, comfy walking or running footwear, alien autopsy tools, or a spare compression coil or warp injector.
   </p>
<p>
    How challenging will it be?
   </p>
<p>
    Some of the puzzles might range in difficulty, but once solved, they should give you a clear idea of where to go next. Because there are so many fields and franchises in science fiction, the trivia will most likely be at a basic level.There won't be any overly physically demanding activities like climbing, swimming or eating gross things.If you need help, you are always welcome to ask a stranger, talk to another team or phone a friend.
   </p>
<p>
    If your crew gets stumped, you can call in to theraceorganizers for help, but it might cost you a time penalty.Yes or no questions cost a 5 minute penalty. More detailed questions cost a 15 minute penalty.
