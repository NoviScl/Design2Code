     Even as the strings of “Lithonia” swoop romantically into their own reflection – like a dove playfully greeting itself in a mirror – there are glints of violence bubbling between the majestic melodic arcs. Sure enough, the rest of Overdue plays out this prophesised feud between palatial grandeur and the seething unrest
