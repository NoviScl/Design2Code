            <h1>Mord Blog</h1>
            <p>I am Mord. I serve my lord Kord with my greatsword.</p>
            <p>And Air, Wand and Teller told us fantastic tales of the great dwarf carrot clan. They dig deep for gems and not from carrots. All Grips is apparently not from carrots. He from Hardly Grips.</p>
            <p>For Napkin is getting a little frisky with Low Wolf Show. I think For Napkin is a little bored with us.</p>
            <p>We not have any more drink. And while a wolf is nice and all, not so much a dragon, me thinks.</p>
            <p>We had to go single file along a path. Then Barrel and Air stopped. Well, guard refused to let Pitter go. Me stay with Pitter to the bitter end.</p>
            <p>I asked if he wanted to wrestle. He got this rash in his eyes. He's a little rashier than a dwarf trollish. He looks important.</p>
            <p>Mords of Wisdom: People not welcome their enemy's people.</p>
            <p>A new day, a new strength, a new start.</p>
