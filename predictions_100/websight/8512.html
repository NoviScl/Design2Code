<h2>Five Years Ago</h2>

<p>Good evening everyone. On this website, you can set up a new conversation to be automatically seen on the ground right away if I'm doing a high altitude run and I want to call the police to ask if there is a doctor nearby. I was just wondering why I was seeing so many fake posts like "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "I'm going to the office" and "I'm going to the cineplex" and "I'm going to the museum" and "I'm going to the zoo" and "I'm going to the beach" and "I'm going to the gym" and "I'm going to the park" and "I'm going to the mall" and "<a href="#">Original Post</a>" and "<a href="#">Original </a></p></div></div></div></body></html>
