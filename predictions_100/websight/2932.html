<p>Welcome to the Rocket Race website, where you can compete in a variety of exciting events. This year's race will be a 4-day event, with a 3-hour deadline. We encourage teams to come and represent their local area, with a chance to win prizes.</p>
<p>How is the race run?</p>
<p>Each team (or group) will come to the location where they will find the next clue, and so on until the team reaches the finish line. The clue might involve solving a puzzle or a word from the science fiction.</p>
<p>Prizes:</p>
<p>First place: $100.</p>
<p>Second place: $80.</p>
<p>What does a crew need?</p>
<p>Each crew needs a reliable vehicle for the race, with at least one experienced driver (pilot). The vehicle must have all the equipment needed for the race, such as a shovel, a pickaxe, and a toolbox. There will be a mandatory stop for lunch, which might be some sort of food or for other miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>It might be handily to bring water, pens, pencils, and a pair of shoes for everyone. For footwear, auto tools, or a spare compressor or car wrench.</p>
<p>How challenging will it be?</p>
<p>Some of the puzzles might be a little difficult to solve, but in most cases, you should be able to find your way. There are no clues to go back to, so you should be able to solve them. Most of the science and science fiction clues will be very easy. More detailed questions might be asked in a minute or two.</p>
<p>How long does it take?</p>
<p>If you are a new team, you can expect to take 10-15 minutes. If you are a returning team, it might take you 5-10 minutes. Otherwise, it might take you 20-30 minutes.</p>
