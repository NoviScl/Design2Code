<h2>Carrot clan</h2>
<p>As we walked, Air and Wander told us fantastic tales of the great dwarven carrot clan. They dig deep for gems and other stuff. All Grins is apparently not from carrots. He from Hardly Grins. For Napkin is getting a little frisky with Wolf Low Show. I think For Napkin is a little bored with us. We not have any more drink. And while a wolf is nice and all, not so much a dragon, me thinks.</p>
<p>We had to go single file along a path. Then Barrel and Air stopped. Well, guard refused to let Pitter go. Me stay with Pitter to the bitter end. I asked if he wanted to wrestle. He got this glint in his eye. I see our people approach with a rather tallish dwarf. He looks important. Mords of Wisdom: People not welcome their enemy's people.</p>
