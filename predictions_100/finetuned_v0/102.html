<h1>Captain's Log</h1>
<p>There are the fairies of the loicow Chris-Chan. His continuing Love Quest: to explore strange new Attraction Locations, to seek out new gals- and new sweetharts; to boldly go where no High-functioning adult virgin has gone before.</p>
<p>Captain's Log was, for a while Chris's usual observing site for a video blog. first appearing in his 26 September 2008 video, it has since become a regular feature, with many of his videos being uploaded on a weekly basis. The videos have ranged from popular song covers to his own original music and even a few obscure covers of other artists.</p>
<p>In many Captain's Logs from 2017, Chris has organized the Captain's Log entries by the date they were uploaded. Sometimes, Chris saves an incorrect date (though the date is technically always incorrect since he says "Saturday" and gives a Gregorian Calendar date, or similar) and gives a Gregorian Calendar date, or similar) and gives a date at all.
