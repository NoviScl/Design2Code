<main>
<p>Teams of 2 to 4 will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traveling on foot and in their team's vehicle around San Diego</li>
<li>Solving puzzles</li>
<li>Testing their sci-fi knowledge</li>
<li>Having fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>Register your team (or sign up to be put on a team) by the registration deadline or get more details by emailing [EMAIL REDACTED]</p>
<p>Cost will be a flat fee of $30 per team, no matter whether the team is 2, 3, or 4 players - Teams must register in advance! Registration deadline is November 3, 2008.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage teams representing different local fan groups to compete and have fun in this adventure!</p>
<p>How the race is run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each team (or "crew") will receive a clue packet, which when solved, will lead them to the location where they will obtain the next clue packet, and so on until the team reaches the finish line. Figuring out the answer to the clues might involve solving a puzzle or knowing trivia from the worlds of science fiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First place: $100.</li>
<li>Second place: $30.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does a crew need?</p>
<ul>
<li>Each crew needs a reliable vehicle for the race, with at least one licensed driver (pilot). The vehicle must have a seat belt for each crewmate. Each crew also needs at least one mobile phone to contact the team if necessary. There will be a mandatory break for lunch so bring some cash for food or other miscellaneous items.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be handy to bring water, pens, snacks, maps, spare change for parking meters, moscot, camera, comic walking or running footwear, alien autopsy tools, or a spare compression collar or warp injector.</p>
<p>How challenging will it be?</p>
<p>Some of the puzzles might range in difficulty, but once solved, they should give you a clue ride of where to go next. Because there are so many fields and franchises in science fiction, the trivia will most likely be at a basic level. There won't be any overly physically demanding activities like climbing, swimming or eating gross things. If you need help, your team or phone a friend.</p>
<p>If your crew gets stumped, you can call in to the race organizers for help, but it might cost you a time penalty. More detailed questions cost a 15 minute penalty.</p>
<p>How do I register?</p>
<p>Send an email to [EMAIL REDACTED] by the registration deadline (November 3, 2008) with the following info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Name</li>
<li>Team Captain's Name with phone and email</li>
<li>Other teammate's names (with optional email)</li>
<li>If you are looking for a team to race with, or would like to invite other fans to be on your team, please so indicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will send out confirmation of registration, as well as updates about the game. The race fee is due on race day prior to the beginning of the Rocket Race.</p>
